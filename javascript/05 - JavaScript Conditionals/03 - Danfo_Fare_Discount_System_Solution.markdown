## Section 1 – Explanations

The **Danfo Fare Discount System** project requires creating a program that calculates a *danfo* passenger’s fare, applies discounts based on their student status and travel time, and displays a message with the final fare. The solution incorporates variables, assignment operators, arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, conditional statements (`if...else`), string concatenation, expressions, statements, comments, and proper formatting (white space and line breaks) as covered in the JavaScript Conditionals lesson.

### Solution Code
```javascript
// Danfo fare discount system for Lagos routes
const passengerName = "Amaka";
const baseFare = 200;
const isStudent = true;
const hour = 15;
// Calculate discount based on student status and time
let discount = 0;
if (isStudent && hour < 12) {
  discount = baseFare * 0.3; // 20% student + 10% morning
} else if (isStudent) {
  discount = baseFare * 0.2; // 20% student
} else if (hour < 12) {
  discount = baseFare * 0.1; // 10% morning
}
// Calculate final fare
let finalFare = baseFare - discount;
// Create message with final fare
let message = passengerName + ", your fare for Oshodi to CMS is ₦" + finalFare + ".";
console.log(message);
```

### Explanation of the Code
This section breaks down each line of the code, explaining its purpose in simple English, tying it to the lesson’s concepts, and relating it to a Nigerian context.

- **Line 1: `// Danfo fare discount system for Lagos routes`**
  - **Concept**: Single-line comment
  - **Explanation**: This comment, starting with `//`, describes the program’s purpose and is ignored by JavaScript. It’s like writing “For danfo fare calculation” in a *conductor’s notebook* to clarify its purpose. Comments make the code easier to understand, similar to labeling a *transport log* with a note like “For Lagos fares”.
  - **Relatable Example**: When you write “For Oshodi to CMS” at the top of a *fare list*, it’s a note for clarity, not part of the calculation. This comment serves the same purpose.

- **Line 2: `const passengerName = "Amaka";`**
  - **Concepts**: Variable declaration (`const`), identifier (`passengerName`), string literal (`"Amaka"`), assignment operator (`=`), semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `const` declares a variable that cannot be reassigned, ideal for the passenger’s name since it won’t change. The identifier `passengerName` uses lower camel case for readability, following JavaScript naming conventions.
    - `= "Amaka"` assigns the string literal `"Amaka"` (text in quotes, a string data type) to `passengerName`.
    - The semicolon (`;`) marks the end of the statement.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like writing “Amaka” on a *danfo ticket* to show who’s paying for the trip, like a permanent entry in a conductor’s record.

- **Line 3: `const baseFare = 200;`**
  - **Concepts**: Variable declaration (`const`), identifier (`baseFare`), number literal (`200`), assignment operator (`=`), semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `const` declares `baseFare`, a fixed fare for the route (e.g., Oshodi to CMS). The identifier `baseFare` is descriptive and uses lower camel case.
    - `= 200` assigns the number literal `200` (₦200) to `baseFare`.
    - The semicolon ends the statement.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like recording ₦200 as the *standard fare for Oshodi to CMS* in a *conductor’s log*, a fixed price for the route.

- **Line 4: `const isStudent = true;`**
  - **Concepts**: Variable declaration (`const`), identifier (`isStudent`), boolean literal (`true`), assignment operator (`=`), semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `const` declares `isStudent`, a fixed boolean indicating if the passenger is a student. The identifier `isStudent` is clear and follows naming rules.
    - `= true` assigns the boolean `true` to `isStudent`, meaning the passenger is a student.
    - The semicolon ends the statement.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like noting that a passenger has a *student ID*, qualifying them for a discount, similar to a *school badge* check.

- **Line 5: `const hour = 15;`**
  - **Concepts**: Variable declaration (`const`), identifier (`hour`), number literal (`15`), assignment operator (`=`), semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `const` declares `hour`, the fixed hour of travel (15 = 3 PM). The identifier `hour` is descriptive.
    - `= 15` assigns the number `15` to `hour`.
    - The semicolon ends the statement.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like recording that the *danfo* trip is at 3 PM, a fixed time for fare calculation, like a *bus schedule*.

- **Line 6: `// Calculate discount based on student status and time`**
  - **Concept**: Single-line comment
  - **Explanation**: This comment explains the purpose of the next block, which calculates the discount. It’s like writing “Check discounts” in a *conductor’s notebook* before applying reductions.
  - **Relatable Example**: When you note “Apply student discount” next to a *fare list*, it’s a reminder of what you’re calculating, just like this comment.

- **Line 7: `let discount = 0;`**
  - **Concepts**: Variable declaration (`let`), identifier (`discount`), number literal (`0`), assignment operator (`=`), semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `let` declares `discount` to store the calculated discount amount. `let` is used because the value will be calculated based on conditions.
    - `= 0` assigns `0` as a starting value, assuming no discount until conditions are checked.
    - The semicolon ends the statement.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like starting with ₦0 discount on a *fare receipt*, to be updated after checking if the passenger qualifies, like a *conductor’s tally*.

- **Line 8: `if (isStudent && hour < 12) {`**
  - **Concepts**: `if` statement, logical operator (`&&`), comparison operator (`<`), expression (`isStudent && hour < 12`), curly braces (`{}`), white space
  - **Explanation**: 
    - The `if` statement checks if both `isStudent` is `true` and `hour < 12` (before noon) are `true` using the `&&` operator. Here, `isStudent` is `true`, but `hour < 12` (15 < 12) is `false`, so the condition is `false`, and this block is skipped.
    - Curly braces define the block to execute if the condition is `true`.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like a *conductor* checking if a passenger is a student *and* traveling in the morning for a bigger discount, like a *school bus* fare rule.

- **Line 9: `discount = baseFare * 0.3; // 20% student + 10% morning`**
  - **Concepts**: Assignment operator (`=`), arithmetic operator (`*`), expression (`baseFare * 0.3`), comment, semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - If the `if` condition is `true`, this calculates a 30% discount (20% for student + 10% for morning) by multiplying `baseFare` (200) by `0.3` (200 * 0.3 = 60).
    - The comment explains the discount’s components.
    - This line is skipped here since the condition is `false`.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like a *conductor* reducing the fare by ₦60 for a student traveling before noon, noted on the *fare receipt*.

- **Line 10: `} else if (isStudent) {`**
  - **Concepts**: `else if` statement, expression (`isStudent`), curly braces (`{}`), white space
  - **Explanation**: 
    - The `else if` checks if `isStudent` is `true` if the previous `if` is `false`. Here, `isStudent` is `true`, so this block runs.
    - Curly braces define the block for this condition.
  - **Relatable Example**: If it’s not morning, the *conductor* checks if the passenger is a student for a discount, like verifying a *student ID*.

- **Line 11: `discount = baseFare * 0.2; // 20% student`**
  - **Concepts**: Assignment operator (`=`), arithmetic operator (`*`), expression (`baseFare * 0.2`), comment, semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - This assigns a 20% discount for students by multiplying `baseFare` (200) by `0.2` (200 * 0.2 = 40), so `discount = 40`.
    - The comment clarifies it’s a student discount.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like a *conductor* reducing the fare by ₦40 for a student, noted as “Student discount” on the *ticket*.

- **Line 12: `} else if (hour < 12) {`**
  - **Concepts**: `else if` statement, comparison operator (`<`), expression (`hour < 12`), curly braces (`{}`), white space
  - **Explanation**: 
    - The `else if` checks if `hour < 12` if the previous conditions are `false`. This block is skipped since the previous `else if` ran.
    - Curly braces define the block.
  - **Relatable Example**: If the passenger isn’t a student, the *conductor* checks if it’s morning for a discount, like a *morning fare* rule.

- **Line 13: `discount = baseFare * 0.1; // 10% morning`**
  - **Concepts**: Assignment operator (`=`), arithmetic operator (`*`), expression (`baseFare * 0.1`), comment, semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - If the condition were `true`, this assigns a 10% discount (200 * 0.1 = 20). It’s skipped here.
    - The comment clarifies it’s a morning discount.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like reducing the fare by ₦20 for a morning trip, noted on the *fare log*.

- **Line 14: `}`**
  - **Concept**: Curly brace closing the `else if` block
  - **Explanation**: This closes the conditional block, ensuring proper structure.
  - **Relatable Example**: It’s like finishing a *fare discount checklist*, ensuring all cases are covered.

- **Line 15: `// Calculate final fare`**
  - **Concept**: Single-line comment
  - **Explanation**: This comment indicates the next line calculates the final fare, like noting “Final fare” in a *conductor’s log*.
  - **Relatable Example**: It’s a reminder of the final step, like tallying the total on a *bus ticket*.

- **Line 16: `let finalFare = baseFare - discount;`**
  - **Concepts**: Variable declaration (`let`), identifier (`finalFare`), expression (`baseFare - discount`), arithmetic operator (`-`), assignment operator (`=`), semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `let` declares `finalFare` to store the fare after discount. `let` is used because it’s calculated.
    - The expression `baseFare - discount` subtracts `40` from `200` to get `160`.
    - `=` assigns `160` to `finalFare`, and `;` ends the statement.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like a *conductor* subtracting a ₦40 discount from a ₦200 fare to get ₦160, written on the *ticket*.

- **Line 17: `// Create message with final fare`**
  - **Concept**: Single-line comment
  - **Explanation**: This comment explains the next line creates the output message, like noting “Write receipt” in a *log*.
  - **Relatable Example**: It’s like preparing to write the final *fare receipt* for the passenger.

- **Line 18: `let message = passengerName + ", your fare for Oshodi to CMS is ₦" + finalFare + ".";`**
  - **Concepts**: Variable declaration (`let`), identifier (`message`), expression (string concatenation with `+`), string literals (`", your fare for Oshodi to CMS is ₦"`, `"."`), assignment operator (`=`), semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `let` declares `message` to store the output string. `let` is used because the message is calculated.
    - The expression concatenates:
      - `passengerName` (“Amaka”).
      - A string literal `", your fare for Oshodi to CMS is ₦"`.
      - `finalFare` (160), converted to a string during concatenation.
      - A string literal `"."`.
    - The result is “Amaka, your fare for Oshodi to CMS is ₦160.”.
    - `=` assigns the string to `message`, and `;` ends the statement.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like a *conductor* writing, “Amaka, your fare is ₦160,” on a *ticket* after applying the discount.

- **Line 19: `console.log(message);`**
  - **Concepts**: Statement, expression (`message`), semicolon (`;`)
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `console.log(message)` displays “Amaka, your fare for Oshodi to CMS is ₦160.” in the console, like a digital *fare receipt*.
    - `message` is an expression that retrieves the string.
    - The semicolon ends the statement.
  - **Relatable Example**: This is like showing a *friend* your *danfo fare receipt* to prove the discounted price, displayed on a *phone screen*.

- **Formatting Notes**:
  - **White Space**: Spaces around operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `<`, `&&`) and consistent indentation (two spaces) make the code readable, like a neat *fare list*.
  - **Line Breaks**: The `message` line is under 80 characters, but long lines could be split for clarity, like a *WhatsApp message*.
  - **Case Sensitivity**: Identifiers use lower camel case, and `if` is lowercase to avoid errors.
  - **Block Scope**: Variables are global, but `const` and `let` ensure proper scoping for future blocks, like separating passengers.

### Connection to Lesson
The solution uses:
- **Variables** (`const passengerName`, `const baseFare`, `const isStudent`, `const hour`, `let discount`, `let finalFare`, `let message`).
- **Data Types** (string for `passengerName`, `message`; numbers for `baseFare`, `hour`, `discount`, `finalFare`; boolean for `isStudent`).
- **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `else if`).
- **Operators** (`=` for assignment, `+` for concatenation, `-` and `*` for arithmetic, `<` for comparison, `&&` for logical AND).
- **Expressions** (e.g., `isStudent && hour < 12`, `baseFare * 0.2`).
- **Statements** (each line is a complete instruction).
- **Comments** (e.g., `// Calculate discount based on student status and time`).
- **Semicolons** (`;`) to separate statements.
- **White Space** for readability.
