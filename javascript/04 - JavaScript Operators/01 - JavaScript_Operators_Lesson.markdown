---

## Section 1 – Explanations

This section explains the concepts in the lesson note step-by-step, using clear language, Nigerian-themed examples, and confidence-building connections to everyday scenarios.

### 1. Operators are for Mathematical and Logical Computations
Operators are symbols that perform operations on values or variables, like adding numbers or comparing values.

- **Explanation**: Operators are like tools in a *market trader’s calculator*—they help you compute or compare things. For example, you can add prices, compare weights, or combine names.
- **Relatable Example**: When you calculate the total cost of *yam* and *fish* at the market or check if your *airtime balance* is enough for a call, you’re using operations similar to JavaScript operators.

### 2. JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to variables, with `=` being the most common.

- **The `=` Operator**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  let y = 2;
  let z = x + y; // z = 12
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `=` operator assigns a value to a variable. `let x = 10;` stores 10 in `x`. In `z = x + y`, it calculates `10 + 2` and assigns `12` to `z`.
  - **Relatable Example**: When you record ₦10 as your *pocket money* (`x = 10`) or add two amounts to get a total, it’s like assigning values on a *market shopping list*.

- **The `+=` Operator**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  x += 5; // x = 15
  ```
  - **Explanation**: `+=` adds a value to a variable and reassigns the result. `x += 5` is the same as `x = x + 5`, adding 5 to `x`’s current value (10) to get 15.
  - **Relatable Example**: If you have ₦10 in your *wallet* and add ₦5 more, `x += 5` updates your balance to ₦15, like topping up your savings.

- **Other Assignment Operators**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  x -= 5; // x = 5
  x *= 5; // x = 50
  x /= 5; // x = 2
  x %= 5; // x = 0
  x **= 5; // x = 100000
  ```
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `-=` subtracts (`x -= 5` means `x = x - 5`).
    - `*=` multiplies (`x *= 5` means `x = x * 5`).
    - `/=` divides (`x /= 5` means `x = x / 5`).
    - `%=` gives the remainder (`x %= 5` means `x = x % 5`).
    - `**=` raises to a power (`x **= 5` means `x = x ** 5`).
  - **Relatable Example**: These are like adjusting your *market budget*: subtracting expenses, multiplying quantities, or dividing shared costs among friends.

- **Logical Assignment Operators (ES2020)**:
  ```javascript
  let x = true;
  x &&= 10; // x = 10 if x is true
  let y = false;
  y ||= 10; // y = 10 if y is false
  let z;
  z ??= 10; // z = 10 if z is undefined or null
  ```
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `&&=` assigns the second value if the first is true.
    - `||=` assigns the second value if the first is false.
    - `??=` assigns the second value if the first is `undefined` or `null`.
  - **Relatable Example**: If you have *airtime* (`true`), `&&=` might add more; if you don’t (`false`), `||=` gives you a default amount; if your balance is unknown (`undefined`), `??=` sets a starting value.

### 3. JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform math on numbers.

- **Addition (`+`)**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  let z = x + y; // z = 7
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `+` operator adds numbers. `x + y` adds 5 and 2 to get 7, stored in `z`.
  - **Relatable Example**: Adding ₦5 for *suya* and ₦2 for a *drink* to get a total of ₦7, like calculating your *market spending*.

- **Subtraction (`-`)**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  let z = x - y; // z = 3
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `-` operator subtracts. `x - y` subtracts 2 from 5 to get 3.
  - **Relatable Example**: If you have ₦5 and spend ₦2 on *pure water*, you’re left with ₦3.

- **Multiplication (`*`)**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  let z = x * y; // z = 10
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `*` operator multiplies. `x * y` multiplies 5 by 2 to get 10.
  - **Relatable Example**: Buying 5 *sachets of milk* at ₦2 each costs ₦10, like calculating bulk purchases.

- **Division (`/`)**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  let z = x / y; // z = 2.5
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `/` operator divides. `x / y` divides 5 by 2 to get 2.5.
  - **Relatable Example**: Sharing ₦5 among 2 friends gives each ₦2.50, like splitting a *danfo fare*.

- **Modulus (`%`)**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  let z = x % y; // z = 1
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `%` operator returns the remainder after division. `5 % 2` gives 1 because 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1.
  - **Relatable Example**: If you have ₦5 and spend ₦2 twice, the remaining ₦1 is like the modulus, the *change* you get back.

- **Increment (`++`)**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  x++; // x = 6
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `++` operator increases a number by 1. `x++` adds 1 to 5, making `x` equal 6.
  - **Relatable Example**: Adding one more *akara* to your count of 5 gives you 6, like incrementing a tally.

- **Decrement (`--`)**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  x--; // x = 4
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `--` operator decreases a number by 1. `x--` subtracts 1 from 5, making `x` equal 4.
  - **Relatable Example**: Eating one *puff-puff* from a pack of 5 leaves you with 4.

- **Exponentiation (`**`)**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let z = x ** 2; // z = 25
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `**` operator raises a number to a power. `x ** 2` calculates 5 squared (25).
  - **Relatable Example**: If you buy 5 *sacks of rice* and each sack’s cost is multiplied by itself (5 * 5), it’s like calculating a bulk order’s value.

- **Example with Expressions**:
  ```javascript
  let a = 3;
  let x = (100 + 50) * a; // x = 450
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Parentheses `()` control operator precedence, ensuring `100 + 50` (150) is calculated first, then multiplied by `a` (3) to get 450.
  - **Relatable Example**: If you buy 3 sets of *school supplies* costing ₦100 + ₦50 each, the total is ₦450, like a bulk purchase calculation.

### 4. String Addition (Concatenation)
The `+` operator concatenates strings when used with text.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let text1 = "John";
  let text2 = "Doe";
  let text3 = text1 + " " + text2; // text3 = "John Doe"
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `+` operator joins strings. Here, it combines “John”, a space, and “Doe” to form “John Doe”.
  - **Relatable Example**: Writing “Chidi” + “ “ + “Okeke” on a *school form* creates your full name, “Chidi Okeke”.

- **Using `+=` for Strings**:
  ```javascript
  let text1 = "What a very ";
  text1 += "nice day"; // text1 = "What a very nice day"
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `+=` operator appends a string to an existing one. `text1 += "nice day"` adds “nice day” to “What a very ”.
  - **Relatable Example**: Adding “good meal” to “I ate a ” on a *WhatsApp status* creates “I ate a good meal”.

- **Adding Strings and Numbers**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5 + 5; // x = 10
  let y = "5" + 5; // y = "55"
  let z = "Hello" + 5; // z = "Hello5"
  ```
  - **Explanation**: When `+` involves a string, it concatenates, converting numbers to strings. `5 + 5` is 10 (number), but `"5" + 5` is “55” (string), and `"Hello" + 5` is “Hello5”.
  - **Relatable Example**: Writing “Price: ₦” + 5 on a *market receipt* gives “Price: ₦5”, combining text and a number.

### 5. JavaScript Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare values and return `true` or `false`.

- **Examples**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let result = x > 8; // result = false
  let text1 = "A";
  let text2 = "B";
  let result2 = text1 < text2; // result2 = true
  ```
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `>` checks if the left value is greater than the right. `5 > 8` is `false`.
    - `<` compares strings alphabetically. `"A" < "B"` is `true` because “A” comes before “B” in the alphabet.
    - Other operators include `==` (equal), `===` (equal value and type), `!=` (not equal), `!==` (not equal value or type), `>=`, and `<=`.
  - **Relatable Example**: Checking if your *JAMB score* (5) is greater than the cutoff (8) is like `x > 8`. Comparing “Amaka” < “Bola” alphabetically is like sorting names in a *class register*.

- **Comparing Different Types**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 2 < "12"; // true
  let y = "2" < "12"; // false
  ```
  - **Explanation**: When comparing a number and a string, JavaScript converts the string to a number (`"12"` becomes 12, so `2 < 12` is `true`). For two strings, it compares alphabetically, so `"2" < "12"` is `false` because “2” comes after “1” in ASCII order.
  - **Relatable Example**: Checking if ₦2 is less than ₦12 is straightforward, but comparing “2” and “12” as text is like sorting *market items* by name, not value.

### 6. JavaScript Logical Operators
Logical operators combine conditions and return `true` or `false`.

- **Operators**:
  - `&&` (AND): True if both conditions are true.
  - `||` (OR): True if at least one condition is true.
  - `!` (NOT): Reverses the truth value.
- **Relatable Example**: To board a *danfo*, you need money AND a destination (`&&`). You can pay with cash OR a card (`||`). If you’re NOT a student (`!`), you pay the full fare.

### 7. Operator Precedence
Operations are performed in a specific order, with multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 100 + 50 * 3; // x = 250
  let y = (100 + 50) * 3; // y = 450
  ```
  - **Explanation**: In `100 + 50 * 3`, multiplication (`50 * 3 = 150`) happens first, then addition (`100 + 150 = 250`). Parentheses in `(100 + 50) * 3` ensure addition first (`150 * 3 = 450`).
  - **Relatable Example**: If you buy 3 *oranges* at ₦50 each and add ₦100 for transport, `100 + 50 * 3` calculates ₦250. Using parentheses, `(100 + 50) * 3`, might represent a bulk deal costing ₦450.

### 8. Spread Operator (`...`)
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let text = "12345";
  let min = Math.min(...text); // min = 1
  ```
  - **Explanation**: The `...` operator splits a string or array into individual elements. `...text` turns “12345” into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so `Math.min(...text)` finds the smallest (1).
  - **Relatable Example**: If you have a *list of prices* (“12345”), `...` is like laying out each price separately to find the cheapest one, like sorting *market goods*.

## Section 2 – Class Exercise

This exercise is designed to be fun, Nigerian-themed, and practical, allowing students to practice operators while building something they can boast about.

### Exercise: Market Price Calculator
**Objective**: Create a program that calculates the total cost of buying two items at a market, applies a discount, and displays a message with the final price.

**Why It’s Cool**: Students will feel proud to create a program that mimics a *market bargaining system*, like negotiating prices at *Oyingbo Market*. They can show friends, “I built a market price calculator with JavaScript!”

**Instructions**:
1. Declare two variables for item prices using `const` (e.g., ₦300 and ₦200).
2. Declare a variable for a discount amount using `const` (e.g., ₦50).
3. Use `let` to calculate the total price after subtracting the discount.
4. Create a message combining the total and a friendly note (e.g., “Your total cost after discount is ₦450.”).
5. Use `console.log()` to display the message.
6. Add a comment explaining what your code does.
7. Ensure readability with spaces and lines under 80 characters.

**Guidance (No Solution)**:
- Think of a *market receipt* after bargaining (e.g., “Total cost after ₦50 discount: ₦450”).
- Use `const` for prices and discount since they’re fixed, and `let` for the total since it’s calculated.
- Use `+` for string concatenation and `-` for subtraction.
- Example structure (not the answer):
  ```javascript
  // My market price calculator
  const price1 = ...;
  const price2 = ...;
  const discount = ...;
  let total = ...;
  let message = ... + ...;
  console.log(...);
  ```

**Connection to Lesson**: This uses assignment (`=`), arithmetic (`+`, `-`), string concatenation (`+`), variables, expressions, statements, comments, and white space.

## Section 3 – Weekly Project

This project combines the lesson’s concepts into a practical, Nigerian-themed task that students will be excited to share.

### Project: Danfo Passenger Fare Checker
**Objective**: Build a program that calculates a *danfo* passenger’s total fare, checks if they have enough money, and displays a message indicating whether they can board.

**Why It’s Exciting**: Students will create a tool that feels like a *danfo conductor’s fare checker*, ensuring passengers can pay for routes like Oshodi to CMS. They can boast, “My program checks if you can board a danfo!” It’s relatable and practical in Nigeria.

**Project Brief**:
- **Goal**: Create a program that:
  1. Stores two route fares and a passenger’s available money in `const` variables.
  2. Calculates the total fare using `let`.
  3. Uses a comparison operator (`>=`) to check if the passenger has enough money.
  4. Displays a message like “Chidi, you have enough money to board!” or “Chidi, you need more money to board.”
- **Milestones**:
  1. Declare `const` variables for two route fares (e.g., ₦200, ₦150) and the passenger’s money (e.g., ₦400).
  2. Use `let` to calculate the total fare (`fare1 + fare2`).
  3. Use a comparison (`money >= total`) to check if the passenger can pay.
  4. Create a message based on the comparison using string concatenation.
  5. Use `console.log()` to display the message.
  6. Add comments to explain each section.
  7. Ensure readability with spaces and line breaks.
- **Extension Ideas**:
  - Add a tip if the passenger has extra money.
  - Include route names in the message (e.g., “Oshodi to CMS: ₦200”).
- **Relatable Scenario**: Imagine a *danfo conductor* checking if a passenger’s money covers the fare for Oshodi to CMS and CMS to Yaba. Your program acts like a smart fare validator.

**Guidance (No Solution)**:
- Use `const` for fares and money since they’re fixed.
- Use `let` for the total and message since they’re calculated.
- Use `>=` to compare money and total fare.
- Use comments to explain steps.
- Break long strings into lines, like:
  ```javascript
  let message = name + ", you " + ... +
                " money to board!";
  ```

**Connection to Lesson**: This uses `const`, `let`, assignment (`=`), arithmetic (`+`), comparison (`>=`), string concatenation, expressions, statements, comments, white space, and line breaks.
