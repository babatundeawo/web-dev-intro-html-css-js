## **Section 1 – Explanations**

The lesson introduces JavaScript as the programming language of the web, explaining its role alongside HTML and CSS, how it’s used to manipulate web content, and various ways to include and display JavaScript output. Below, I’ll break down each concept in the lesson note step-by-step, using simple English and Nigerian-themed examples to make it relatable.

### **What is JavaScript?**
JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive. It works alongside:
- **HTML**: Defines the content of a webpage, like the text and images you see (e.g., the menu list on a restaurant’s website).
- **CSS**: Controls the look and layout, like colors and fonts (e.g., making a website look as vibrant as a Nigerian market stall).
- **JavaScript**: Adds behavior, like making a button work or showing a pop-up (e.g., clicking “Order Now” on a Jumia website to add an item to your cart).

**Relatable Analogy**: Think of a website as a danfo bus. HTML is the body of the bus (its structure), CSS is the paint and decorations (its appearance), and JavaScript is the engine that makes the bus move or honk when you press a button.

### **Why Study JavaScript?**
JavaScript is essential because it brings websites to life. For example, it can:
- Calculate data, like totaling the cost of items in an online market.
- Validate data, like checking if a phone number entered for airtime recharge is correct.
- Update HTML and CSS, like changing the text on a button after you click it.

**Nigerian Context**: Imagine you’re building a website for a local buka (eatery). JavaScript lets you add a button that, when clicked, shows the daily special (e.g., “Today’s Soup: Egusi!”). This makes your website exciting and useful, something you can proudly show your friends.

### **JavaScript is Free and Built-In**
You don’t need to download JavaScript—it’s already in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) on your phone, laptop, or tablet. It’s free for everyone to use, so you can start coding right away without spending money like you would on airtime or data.

**Relatable Example**: Just like how you don’t need to buy WhatsApp to send messages (it’s already on your phone), JavaScript is ready to use in your browser.

### **JavaScript Can Change HTML Content**
JavaScript can find an HTML element (like a paragraph) and change its content. The method `document.getElementById()` finds an element by its ID, and `innerHTML` changes its content.

**Example from the Lesson**:
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `document`: Refers to the webpage.
  - `getElementById("demo")`: Finds the HTML element with `id="demo"` (like finding a specific shop in a market by its name).
  - `innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript"`: Changes the content of that element to “Hello JavaScript” (like updating the shop’s signboard to show a new product).
- **Single vs. Double Quotes**: JavaScript accepts both `'Hello JavaScript'` and `"Hello JavaScript"`. Use either, but be consistent.

**Nigerian-Themed Example**:
```javascript
document.getElementById("bukaMenu").innerHTML = "Today’s Special: Pounded Yam and Vegetable Soup!";
```
- This code could update a restaurant’s website to show the daily special, like a signboard at a buka announcing today’s meal.

### **JavaScript Can Change HTML Attributes**
JavaScript can change attributes of HTML elements, like the `src` of an image (the source file it displays).

**Example from the Lesson**:
```javascript
document.getElementById("lightBulb").src = "on.jpg";
```
- **Explanation**:
  - Finds an image with `id="lightBulb"`.
  - Changes its `src` attribute to `on.jpg`, switching the image (e.g., from an off bulb to an on bulb).
- **Nigerian Context**: Think of toggling a generator’s image on a website from “off” to “on” when you click a button, mimicking how you switch on a gen in your house.

### **JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)**
JavaScript can modify the style of an element, like its font size or color.

**Example from the Lesson**:
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";
```
- **Explanation**:
  - Finds the element with `id="demo"`.
  - Changes its `fontSize` style to `35px`, making the text larger.
- **Nigerian Example**: Imagine making the price tag on an online market website bigger so customers notice it, like `₦500` displayed boldly.

### **JavaScript Can Hide/Show HTML Elements**
JavaScript can hide or show elements by changing the `display` style.

**Examples from the Lesson**:
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none"; // Hides the element
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block"; // Shows the element
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `style.display = "none"`: Makes the element invisible, like hiding a “Sold Out” item in an online shop.
  - `style.display = "block"`: Makes it visible again, like showing the item when it’s back in stock.
- **Nigerian Context**: Imagine hiding a “No Fuel” sign on a fuel station’s website when fuel is available again.

### **Where to Place JavaScript**
JavaScript code can go inside `<script>` tags in the `<head>` or `<body>` of an HTML page, or in an external `.js` file.

- **In `<head>`**:
  ```html
  <head>
    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
    <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
  </body>
  ```
  - The function `myFunction` is defined in `<head>` and called when the button is clicked.
  - **Nigerian Analogy**: Think of `<head>` as the planning stage of a party, where you write down the DJ’s playlist (the function) before the event starts.

- **In `<body>`**:
  ```html
  <body>
    <p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
    <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
      }
    </script>
  </body>
  ```
  - The script is at the bottom of `<body>`, which can make the page load faster because the HTML loads before the JavaScript runs.
  - **Nigerian Analogy**: This is like setting up the DJ’s equipment after guests arrive at the party, ensuring the venue (webpage) is ready first.

- **External JavaScript**:
  ```html
  <script src="myScript.js"></script>
  ```
  - The script is stored in a separate file (`myScript.js`), making it reusable across multiple pages.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Keeps HTML clean, like organizing your market stall’s inventory in a separate storeroom.
    - Easier to maintain, like updating one price list for all your shops.
    - Speeds up page loading if the file is cached, like reusing a popular jingle for radio ads.
  - **Nigerian Example**: A website for a Nigerian school could use one `.js` file to update exam results across all class pages.

### **JavaScript Output Methods**
JavaScript can display data in several ways:
1. **innerHTML**: Changes the content of an HTML element.
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World";
   ```
   - **Nigerian Example**: Updates a website’s banner to say “Welcome to Lagos Fashion Week!”

2. **innerText**: Changes only the text content, not HTML tags.
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById("demo").innerText = "Hello World";
   ```
   - **Nigerian Example**: Changes a restaurant menu’s text to “Amala: ₦500” without adding bold or other formatting.

3. **document.write()**: Writes directly to the HTML output (used for testing, not production).
   ```javascript
   document.write(5 + 6); // Outputs 11
   ```
   - **Warning**: Using it after the page loads deletes all existing HTML, like clearing a market stall to display one item.
   - **Nigerian Example**: For testing, you might use it to display the total cost of items in a cart.

4. **window.alert()**: Shows a pop-up alert box.
   ```javascript
   alert(5 + 6); // Shows a pop-up with "11"
   ```
   - **Nigerian Example**: Displays a pop-up saying “Your airtime recharge of ₦100 was successful!”

5. **console.log()**: Outputs data to the browser’s console (for debugging).
   ```javascript
   console.log(5 + 6); // Shows 11 in the console
   ```
   - **Nigerian Example**: Logs the number of visitors to an event’s website for the developer to check.

6. **window.print()**: Opens the browser’s print dialog to print the page.
   ```javascript
   window.print();
   ```
   - **Nigerian Example**: Prints a student’s JAMB result slip from a school’s website.

**Confidence-Building Note**: These concepts are like learning to use a POS machine at a market stall. Start with small actions (like changing text), and soon you’ll build websites as impressive as a Nigerian tech startup’s app!

## **Section 2 – Class Exercise**

**Exercise: Build a “Market Price Updater”**

This exercise lets you practice changing HTML content and styles using JavaScript, connecting to the lesson’s concepts of `innerHTML`, `innerText`, and `style` properties. It’s designed to be fun, relatable, and something you can show off to friends.

**Objective**: Create a webpage for a Nigerian market stall that updates the price of an item when a button is clicked.

**Step-by-Step Guidance**:
1. Create an HTML file with:
   - A `<p>` element with `id="itemPrice"` to display the item name and price (e.g., “Yam: ₦300”).
   - A button that says “Update Price” and calls a JavaScript function when clicked.
2. Write a JavaScript function in a `<script>` tag that:
   - Uses `document.getElementById("itemPrice").innerHTML` to change the item and price (e.g., to “Rice: ₦500”).
   - Uses `document.getElementById("itemPrice").style.fontSize` to make the text larger (e.g., “20px”).
3. Test your code in a browser to see the price update when you click the button.
4. (Optional) Use `alert()` to show a pop-up saying “Price updated successfully!”

**Nigerian Connection**: This is like updating the price board at a market stall to reflect new stock, something you can proudly show your peers as a real-world skill.

**Challenge**: Try changing the text color to green using `style.color = "green"` to make the new price stand out, like a flashy market sign.

## **Section 3 – Weekly Project**

**Project: Build a “School Announcement Board”**

This project combines the lesson’s concepts (`innerHTML`, `style`, functions, and script placement) to create a simple webpage for a Nigerian school that updates announcements dynamically. It’s practical, fun, and something you can boast about to classmates.

**Project Brief**:
Create a webpage that displays a school announcement (e.g., “No classes tomorrow!”) and allows the user to update it by clicking a button. The announcement should also change style (e.g., font size or color) to grab attention.

**Milestones**:
1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Create a `<p>` element with `id="announcement"` to display the initial announcement (e.g., “Welcome to Lagos High School!”).
   - Add a button with `onclick="updateAnnouncement()"` to call a JavaScript function.
2. **JavaScript Function**:
   - Write a function `updateAnnouncement()` in a `<script>` tag in the `<body>` or an external `.js` file.
   - Use `document.getElementById("announcement").innerHTML` to change the announcement (e.g., to “Midterm break starts next week!”).
   - Use `document.getElementById("announcement").style` to change the font size or color (e.g., `style.color = "blue"`).
3. **Enhancement**:
   - Add an `alert()` to confirm the announcement was updated, like “New announcement posted!”
   - Optionally, use `style.display` to hide the old announcement before showing the new one with a delay (hint: explore `setTimeout` if you’re curious, but it’s not required).
4. **Test and Share**:
   - Test the webpage in a browser to ensure the announcement updates and looks good.
   - Show it to friends, saying, “I built a digital noticeboard for our school!”

**Nigerian Connection**: This project mimics a school’s noticeboard, like the one outside the principal’s office, but digital and interactive. It’s something you can proudly share, saying, “I coded a website that updates our school announcements like a pro!”

**Extension Ideas**:
- Add a second button to reset the announcement to the original text.
- Experiment with other styles, like making the text bold (`style.fontWeight = "bold"`) to mimic a chalkboard’s emphasis.
