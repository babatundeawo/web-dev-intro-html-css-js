## **1. The Origin of Problems: Sin and Its Effects**

- The world is full of problems: injustice, suffering, broken systems, poverty, and conflict.  
- These are not merely social issues — they have a **spiritual root**.  
- **Sin** entered the world (Genesis 3), corrupting God’s good creation.  
- Creation now “groans” for redemption (Romans 8:22).  
- In 1 Samuel 15, Saul’s disobedience causes leadership failure; Israel’s crisis reflects sin’s consequences.  
- In 1 Samuel 16, God intervenes — He raises a new man after His own heart.  

**Application:**  
Our world’s problems are deeper than lack of intelligence or resources — they are rooted in separation from God. True solutions must be *spiritual before they are social.*

## **2. God’s Solution: His Anointed One**

- David’s anointing was God’s answer to Israel’s leadership crisis.  
- God’s choice surprised everyone: *“Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”* (1 Sam 16:7)  
- Samuel anoints David with oil — a symbol of divine appointment and empowerment.  
- “The Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon David from that day forward.” (v.13)  
- David foreshadows **Christ**, the ultimate *Anointed One* (Messiah = “the anointed”).  
- Jesus declared, *“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me…”* (Luke 4:18).  
- Through His death and resurrection, Christ became God’s perfect solution to sin and brokenness.

**Application:**  
The answer to our world’s problems is not human systems or politics — it’s the anointed Savior, Jesus Christ.

## **3. God Uses Humans (Anointed by His Spirit) to Carry On Redemption**

- After being anointed, David steps into a new phase: the Spirit’s empowerment.  
- God uses him to:
  - Defeat Goliath (1 Sam 17)
  - Unite Israel (2 Sam 5)
  - Establish worship (2 Sam 6)
- The same Spirit now anoints every believer:
  - *“You have an anointing from the Holy One.”* (1 John 2:20)  
  - *“We are Christ’s ambassadors.”* (2 Cor 5:20)
- We continue the redemptive mission — bringing peace, healing, and hope.

**Application:**  
You are not just saved; you are *sent*.  
God’s Spirit enables believers to become problem solvers in every domain — business, science, governance, education, and ministry.

## **4. Christianity’s Legacy of Innovation**

- The **Christian worldview** teaches that creation is rational and good — and can be studied, improved, and cared for.  
- This belief laid the foundation for **modern science and progress**:
  - Many early scientists were devout Christians — Isaac Newton, Kepler, Boyle.
  - They saw studying creation as worshiping the Creator.  
- **Christian institutions** birthed universities, hospitals, and schools.  
- The gospel inspired reforms in law, human rights, and social care.  
- Christian creativity and service are living evidence of God’s Spirit in human culture.  

**Application:**  
Following Christ brings wholeness not only to individuals but to societies.  
Believers should lead in innovation, creativity, and problem-solving — reflecting the Creator.

## **5. Our Call: You as an Anointed Problem Solver**

### **Encouragement**
David was the least expected choice — young, a shepherd — yet God said, *“This is the one.”*  
God often uses the overlooked and humble to accomplish His purpose.

### **Empowerment**
“The Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward.”  
The same Spirit lives in you (Romans 8:11).  
Your anointing is not a one-time event — it’s an ongoing empowerment.

### **Mission**
Identify the problems in your sphere:
- Workplace injustice  
- Community poverty  
- Family conflict  
- Cultural confusion  
Ask: *“How can I bring Spirit-filled solutions here?”*

### **Excellence**
Doing your work well is an act of worship.  
A Christian should be known for excellence, honesty, and creativity — that’s anointing in action.

### **Community**
David was anointed “in the presence of his brothers.”  
Our calling is not solitary — the Church is a fellowship of anointed problem solvers.

### **Hope**
Some problems seem unfixable, but God finishes what He starts (Phil 1:6).  
We serve with endurance and faith, knowing God’s purposes prevail.

## **Practical Steps**

1. **Reflect:** What problem has God called you to address?  
2. **Ask:** What gifts, resources, or opportunities has He given you?  
3. **Act:** Take one Spirit-led step this week toward a solution.  
4. **Pray:** Seek fresh anointing daily.  
5. **Celebrate:** Give God glory for every breakthrough.

---

## **Conclusion**

David’s anointing teaches us:
- God sees the heart.  
- God chooses the unlikely.  
- God empowers by His Spirit.  
- God sends His anointed ones to bring solutions.  

Through Jesus, the ultimate Anointed One, we are redeemed and sent to redeem.  
As Christians, we are called to be **anointed problem solvers** — in our homes, workplaces, and nations.  
Let us embrace that calling, depend on the Holy Spirit, and bring heaven’s wisdom to earthly problems.
