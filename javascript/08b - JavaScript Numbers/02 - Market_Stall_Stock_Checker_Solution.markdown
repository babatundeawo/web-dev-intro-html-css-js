# **Solution to the Market Stall Stock Checker Exercise**

This document provides the complete code solution for the **Market Stall Stock Checker** class exercise from the **JavaScript Number Properties and Bitwise Operations** lesson, tailored for Nigerian beginners. The solution uses **bitwise operations** and **number properties** to check which items a market vendor and customer both have/want, ensuring the program is practical, fun, and relatable to Nigerian students. Below, the code is presented with a detailed explanation of each part, following the Nigeria-focused instructional framework.

## **Explanation**

The **Market Stall Stock Checker** exercise requires students to create a program that uses **bitwise operations** (`&`) and **number properties** (`Number.isInteger`, `Number.isFinite`) to determine which items a vendor and customer both have/want in a market scenario. The items are represented as binary flags (e.g., `1` for rice, `2` for beans, `4` for yam), and the program validates inputs to ensure they are valid integers. The output is a user-friendly message, like “We both have rice and yam!” or “No matching items,” making it a boast-worthy project for students in a Nigerian context, such as managing a stall in Oshodi or Balogun market.

### **Code Solution**

```javascript
// Define item flags (using powers of 2 for binary representation)
const RICE = 1; // 0001
const BEANS = 2; // 0010
const YAM = 4; // 0100

// Get vendor's stock and customer's wants
let vendorStock = 5; // 0101 (rice + yam)
let customerWants = 1; // 0001 (rice)

// Validate inputs using Number properties
if (Number.isInteger(vendorStock) && Number.isFinite(vendorStock) &&
    Number.isInteger(customerWants) && Number.isFinite(customerWants)) {
    
    // Use bitwise AND to find common items
    let commonItems = vendorStock & customerWants;
    
    // Check if there are common items
    if (commonItems === 0) {
        console.log("No matching items between vendor and customer.");
    } else {
        // Build a message based on common items
        let message = "We both have: ";
        let items = [];
        if (commonItems & RICE) items.push("rice");
        if (commonItems & BEANS) items.push("beans");
        if (commonItems & YAM) items.push("yam");
        message += items.join(" and ") + "!";
        console.log(message);
    }
} else {
    console.log("Invalid input! Please enter valid numbers for stock and wants.");
}
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Defining Item Flags**:
   - **Code**: `const RICE = 1; const BEANS = 2; const YAM = 4;`
   - **Explanation**: Each item is assigned a unique power of 2, which corresponds to a single bit in binary:
     - `RICE = 1` (binary `0001`): Represents rice.
     - `BEANS = 2` (binary `0010`): Represents beans.
     - `YAM = 4` (binary `0100`): Represents yam.
   - **Relatable Analogy**: Think of these as labels on baskets in a market stall. Each basket (rice, beans, yam) has a unique code, and combining them (e.g., `5 = 0101` for rice and yam) is like putting items together in one bag.

2. **Setting Vendor and Customer Values**:
   - **Code**: `let vendorStock = 5; let customerWants = 1;`
   - **Explanation**:
     - `vendorStock = 5` (binary `0101`) means the vendor has rice (`1`) and yam (`4`) because `5 = 1 + 4`.
     - `customerWants = 1` (binary `0001`) means the customer wants only rice.
     - These numbers act like a checklist for items, using binary to track multiple items in one number.
   - **Relatable Analogy**: Imagine a vendor at Balogun market with rice and yam in stock, and a customer who only wants rice. The numbers represent their “lists.”

3. **Validating Inputs with Number Properties**:
   - **Code**: `if (Number.isInteger(vendorStock) && Number.isFinite(vendorStock) && Number.isInteger(customerWants) && Number.isFinite(customerWants))`
   - **Explanation**:
     - `Number.isInteger(vendorStock)` checks if `vendorStock` is a whole number (e.g., `5` is valid, but `5.5` or `"rice"` isn’t).
     - `Number.isFinite(vendorStock)` ensures `vendorStock` isn’t `Infinity` or `NaN` (e.g., `100 / "apple"` would return `NaN`).
     - The same checks apply to `customerWants`.
     - This ensures the inputs are valid before performing bitwise operations.
   - **Relatable Analogy**: It’s like a market vendor checking if a customer’s payment is real money (finite) and in whole naira (integer), not coins or fake notes.

4. **Finding Common Items with Bitwise AND**:
   - **Code**: `let commonItems = vendorStock & customerWants;`
   - **Explanation**:
     - The `&` operator compares the binary digits of `vendorStock` (`0101`) and `customerWants` (`0001`).
     - Result: `0101 & 0001 = 0001` (decimal `1`), meaning the only common item is rice.
     - This stores the common items in `commonItems`.
   - **Relatable Analogy**: This is like checking which items both the vendor and customer agree on selling/buying. If both have rice (`1`), it shows up in the result.

5. **Checking for No Common Items**:
   - **Code**: `if (commonItems === 0) { console.log("No matching items between vendor and customer."); }`
   - **Explanation**:
     - If `commonItems` is `0`, it means no bits match (no common items).
     - The program prints a message to inform the user.
   - **Relatable Analogy**: If a customer wants beans but the vendor only has rice and yam, there’s no match, like saying, “Sorry, we don’t have what you want!”

6. **Building the Output Message**:
   - **Code**:
     ```javascript
     let message = "We both have: ";
     let items = [];
     if (commonItems & RICE) items.push("rice");
     if (commonItems & BEANS) items.push("beans");
     if (commonItems & YAM) items.push("yam");
     message += items.join(" and ") + "!";
     console.log(message);
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Creates an array `items` to store the names of common items.
     - Uses `&` to check each item flag:
       - `commonItems & RICE` checks if rice (`1`) is in `commonItems` (e.g., `0001 & 0001 = 0001`, so rice is included).
       - Similarly for beans (`2`) and yam (`4`).
     - Joins the items with “ and ” (e.g., `["rice", "yam"]` becomes “rice and yam”).
     - Prints a friendly message like “We both have: rice!”.
   - **Relatable Analogy**: It’s like the vendor shouting, “We have rice for you!” or “We have rice and yam!” to confirm what they can sell to the customer.

7. **Handling Invalid Inputs**:
   - **Code**: `else { console.log("Invalid input! Please enter valid numbers for stock and wants."); }`
   - **Explanation**:
     - If the inputs fail the `isInteger` or `isFinite` checks, this message warns the user.
     - This prevents errors from invalid inputs like `NaN` or non-integer values.
   - **Relatable Analogy**: It’s like a vendor rejecting a customer’s fake money or a request for “half a yam” when only whole items are sold.

### **How It Connects to the Lesson**
- **Bitwise Operations**: The `&` operator is used to find common items, directly applying the lesson’s bitwise AND concept.
- **Number Properties**: `Number.isInteger` and `Number.isFinite` validate inputs, ensuring they are suitable for bitwise operations, reinforcing the lesson’s number property checks.
- **Nigerian Context**: The market stall scenario makes the program relatable, as students can imagine running a stall in a familiar setting like Oshodi market.
- **Boast-Worthy**: The program produces a practical output that students can show off to friends, saying, “I built a program to manage a market stall!”

### **Sample Output**
- For `vendorStock = 5` (rice + yam), `customerWants = 1` (rice):
  ```
  We both have: rice!
  ```
- For `vendorStock = 5` (rice + yam), `customerWants = 2` (beans):
  ```
  No matching items between vendor and customer.
  ```
- For `vendorStock = "invalid"`:
  ```
  Invalid input! Please enter valid numbers for stock and wants.
  ```
