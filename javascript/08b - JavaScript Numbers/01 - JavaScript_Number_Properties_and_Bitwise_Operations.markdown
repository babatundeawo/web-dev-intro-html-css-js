---

## **Section 1 – Explanations**

This section explains the concepts of **JavaScript Number Properties** and **Bitwise Operations** as outlined in the lesson note, breaking them down step-by-step with relatable Nigerian analogies. Each concept is explained clearly, and where example code is provided, it is expanded thoroughly. For concepts without examples, minimal, beginner-friendly examples tied to everyday Nigerian experiences are created.

### **JavaScript Number Properties**

**What are Number Properties?**
Number properties in JavaScript are like special labels on a container that hold specific values related to numbers. Imagine you have a **sachet of pure water** with labels showing its weight, volume, or expiry date. Similarly, JavaScript’s `Number` object has properties like `Number.MAX_VALUE` or `Number.NaN` that provide information about numbers. These properties are accessed directly using `Number.propertyName` and cannot be used on variables (e.g., `x.MAX_VALUE` won’t work).

#### **1. Number.EPSILON**
- **Explanation**: `Number.EPSILON` represents the smallest difference between 1 and the next larger floating-point number. It’s like trying to measure the tiniest extra drop of water you can add to a full glass before it overflows. In JavaScript, numbers are stored with limited precision, so `Number.EPSILON` helps with very small calculations.
- **Relatable Analogy**: Think of trying to add just one more grain of garri to a measuring cup that’s already full. The tiniest amount you can add without changing the measurement significantly is like `Number.EPSILON`.
- **Example from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = Number.EPSILON;
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `Number.EPSILON` is a constant value (approximately `2.220446049250313e-16`).
    - `let x = Number.EPSILON;` assigns this tiny value to the variable `x`.
    - You can use `x` in calculations where precision matters, like comparing two very close numbers.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let priceOfBread = 100.00000000000001;
    let priceOfBread2 = 100;
    let difference = priceOfBread - priceOfBread2;
    console.log(difference < Number.EPSILON); // true (they are practically the same)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Imagine you’re comparing the price of two loaves of bread at Agege market. They seem identical, but one is a tiny fraction of a kobo more. `Number.EPSILON` helps you decide if the difference is so small it doesn’t matter.

- **Note**: This is an ES6 feature, so it won’t work in old browsers like Internet Explorer.

#### **2. Number.MAX_VALUE**
- **Explanation**: `Number.MAX_VALUE` is the largest number JavaScript can handle (approximately `1.7976931348623157e+308`). It’s like the maximum amount of money you could fit into a bank account before the system crashes!
- **Relatable Analogy**: Imagine the largest pile of naira notes you could stack in a market stall before it becomes impossible to count. That’s `Number.MAX_VALUE`.
- **Example from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = Number.MAX_VALUE;
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `Number.MAX_VALUE` is a constant representing the biggest possible number.
    - `let x = Number.MAX_VALUE;` stores this huge number in `x`.
    - If you try to go beyond this, JavaScript returns `Infinity`.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let maxPrice = Number.MAX_VALUE;
    console.log(maxPrice); // A very large number
    console.log(maxPrice + 1e308); // Infinity (too big for JavaScript!)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Imagine trying to add more naira to the largest possible market transaction. JavaScript says, “This is too much!” and returns `Infinity`.

- **Note**: You can’t use `x.MAX_VALUE` if `x` is a variable—it’s `Number.MAX_VALUE` only.

#### **3. Number.MIN_VALUE**
- **Explanation**: `Number.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest positive number JavaScript can represent (approximately `5e-324`). It’s like the tiniest kobo you can pay for an item in a market.
- **Relatable Analogy**: Think of the smallest coin you can use to buy something at Oyingbo market. `Number.MIN_VALUE` is that tiny amount in JavaScript.
- **Example from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = Number.MIN_VALUE;
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `Number.MIN_VALUE` is a constant for the smallest positive number.
    - `let x = Number.MIN_VALUE;` assigns this tiny value to `x`.
    - Anything smaller than this becomes `0` in JavaScript.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let smallestPrice = Number.MIN_VALUE;
    console.log(smallestPrice); // A very tiny number
    console.log(smallestPrice / 2); // 0 (too small to represent)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Imagine trying to split the smallest kobo into an even smaller amount. JavaScript can’t handle it and returns `0`.

#### **4. Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER and Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER**
- **Explanation**: These represent the largest and smallest integers JavaScript can safely handle without losing precision: `9007199254740991` (2^53 - 1) and `-9007199254740991` (-(2^53 - 1)). Beyond these, JavaScript starts rounding numbers, which can cause errors.
- **Relatable Analogy**: Imagine counting the number of people at a Lagos bus stop. You can count accurately up to a certain number, but beyond that, you start estimating, and mistakes creep in. These properties define the “safe counting range.”
- **Example from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  let y = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` is `9007199254740991`.
    - `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` is `-9007199254740991`.
    - `let x = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;` stores the max safe integer in `x`.
    - `let y = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;` stores the min safe integer in `y`.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let maxPeople = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    console.log(maxPeople); // 9007199254740991
    console.log(maxPeople + 1 === maxPeople + 2); // true (precision lost!)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Imagine counting passengers in a danfo bus. Beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, JavaScript can’t tell if you added one or two more people—it’s no longer precise.

#### **5. Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY and Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY**
- **Explanation**: `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` is a value larger than any number (like “infinity”), and `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is smaller than any negative number. These occur when calculations overflow.
- **Relatable Analogy**: Imagine trying to count all the stars in the sky (`POSITIVE_INFINITY`) or owing a debt so large it feels bottomless (`NEGATIVE_INFINITY`).
- **Examples from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
  let y = 1 / 0; // Returns POSITIVE_INFINITY
  let z = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
  let w = -1 / 0; // Returns NEGATIVE_INFINITY
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` is a constant for infinity.
    - `let x = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;` assigns infinity to `x`.
    - `let y = 1 / 0;` divides 1 by 0, which JavaScript can’t handle, so it returns `POSITIVE_INFINITY`.
    - `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is a constant for negative infinity.
    - `let z = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;` assigns negative infinity to `z`.
    - `let w = -1 / 0;` divides -1 by 0, resulting in `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let marketSales = Number.MAX_VALUE * 2;
    console.log(marketSales); // Infinity
    let marketDebt = -Number.MAX_VALUE * 2;
    console.log(marketDebt); // -Infinity
    ```
    - **Explanation**: If your market sales grow beyond the largest number or your debts go below the smallest negative number, JavaScript calls it `Infinity` or `-Infinity`.

#### **6. Number.NaN**
- **Explanation**: `Number.NaN` means “Not a Number” and represents an invalid number result, like trying to divide a number by a word.
- **Relatable Analogy**: Imagine trying to calculate how many bags of rice you can buy with “fish” instead of naira. It doesn’t make sense, so JavaScript says `NaN`.
- **Examples from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = Number.NaN;
  let y = 100 / "Apple";
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `Number.NaN` is a constant representing an invalid number.
    - `let x = Number.NaN;` assigns `NaN` to `x`.
    - `let y = 100 / "Apple";` tries to divide 100 by a string, which isn’t a valid number, so `y` becomes `NaN`.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let price = 500 / "mango";
    console.log(price); // NaN
    console.log(isNaN(price)); // true (confirms it’s not a valid number)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Trying to divide the cost of a product by a word like “mango” is like asking, “How many mangos fit into 500 naira?” It’s invalid, so JavaScript returns `NaN`.

#### **7. Number Methods (isFinite, isInteger, isNaN, isSafeInteger, etc.)**
- **Explanation**: The lesson mentions methods like `isFinite()`, `isInteger()`, `isNaN()`, and `isSafeInteger()`. These check properties of numbers:
  - `isFinite()`: Checks if a value is a finite number (not `Infinity` or `NaN`).
  - `isInteger()`: Checks if a value is a whole number (no decimals).
  - `isNaN()`: Checks if a value is `NaN`.
  - `isSafeInteger()`: Checks if a number is within the safe integer range.
- **Relatable Analogy**: These methods are like a market vendor checking if your money is real (finite), whole (integer), fake (`NaN`), or within a safe amount for a transaction.
- **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
  ```javascript
  let airtime = 100;
  let invalidAirtime = 100 / "MTN";
  console.log(Number.isFinite(airtime)); // true
  console.log(Number.isFinite(invalidAirtime)); // false
  console.log(Number.isInteger(airtime)); // true
  console.log(Number.isNaN(invalidAirtime)); // true
  console.log(Number.isSafeInteger(9007199254740991)); // true
  console.log(Number.isSafeInteger(9007199254740992)); // false
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Imagine checking if your airtime recharge is valid (`isFinite`), a whole amount (`isInteger`), not fake (`isNaN`), or within a safe range for a transaction (`isSafeInteger`).

#### **8. JavaScript BigInt**
- **Explanation**: `BigInt` is a new data type for handling very large integers that exceed the safe integer range (`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`). It’s like using a bigger calculator for counting huge numbers that a regular calculator can’t handle.
- **Relatable Analogy**: Imagine counting all the grains of rice in a warehouse. A regular number can’t handle it, but `BigInt` can.
- **Examples from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 9999999999999999;
  let y = 9999999999999999n;
  let z = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345);
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `let x = 9999999999999999;` creates a regular number, but it loses precision (becomes `10000000000000000`).
    - `let y = 9999999999999999n;` creates a `BigInt` by adding `n`, keeping precision.
    - `let z = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345);` creates a `BigInt` using the `BigInt()` function.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let totalVotes = 9999999999999999n;
    let moreVotes = totalVotes + 1n;
    console.log(moreVotes); // 10000000000000000n (precise)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Imagine counting votes in a national election. Regular numbers might round off, but `BigInt` keeps every vote accurate.

- **Note**: You can’t mix `BigInt` and `Number` in operations (e.g., `5n + 5` fails). Convert one to the other first (e.g., `Number(5n) + 5`).

### **JavaScript Bitwise Operations**

**What are Bitwise Operations?**
Bitwise operations work on numbers at the binary level (0s and 1s). Think of binary as a secret code where numbers are written as a series of switches (on = 1, off = 0). Bitwise operations manipulate these switches to perform calculations, like checking permissions or compressing data.

- **Relatable Analogy**: Imagine a market stall with a row of light switches controlling different items (e.g., rice, beans, yam). Bitwise operations are like flipping switches to decide which items to sell or combine.

#### **1. Bitwise AND (&)**
- **Explanation**: Returns `1` only if both bits are `1`. It’s like saying, “Sell an item only if both the buyer and seller agree.”
- **Example from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5 & 1;
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `5` in binary is `0101`.
    - `1` in binary is `0001`.
    - `5 & 1` compares each bit: `0101 & 0001 = 0001` (decimal `1`).
    - `let x = 5 & 1;` assigns `1` to `x`.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let hasRice = 5; // 0101 (rice and yam available)
    let wantsRice = 1; // 0001 (wants only rice)
    let canSell = hasRice & wantsRice;
    console.log(canSell); // 1 (can sell rice)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Imagine a market where `5` means you have rice and yam, and `1` means the customer wants rice. `&` checks if you both agree on rice.

#### **2. Bitwise OR (|)**
- **Explanation**: Returns `1` if at least one bit is `1`. It’s like saying, “Sell if either the buyer wants rice or yam.”
- **Example from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5 | 1;
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `5` in binary is `0101`.
    - `1` in binary is `0001`.
    - `5 | 1` compares each bit: `0101 | 0001 = 0101` (decimal `5`).
    - `let x = 5 | 1;` assigns `5` to `x`.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let hasRice = 5; // 0101 (rice and yam)
    let wantsRiceOrYam = 1; // 0001 (wants rice)
    let canSell = hasRice | wantsRiceOrYam;
    console.log(canSell); // 5 (can sell rice or yam)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: The customer wants rice, and you have rice and yam. `|` confirms you can sell something they want.

#### **3. Bitwise XOR (^)**
- **Explanation**: Returns `1` if the bits are different. It’s like saying, “Sell only the items that one of us has but not both.”
- **Example from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5 ^ 1;
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `5` in binary is `0101`.
    - `1` in binary is `0001`.
    - `5 ^ 1` compares each bit: `0101 ^ 0001 = 0100` (decimal `4`).
    - `let x = 5 ^ 1;` assigns `4` to `x`.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let hasRice = 5; // 0101 (rice and yam)
    let wantsOnlyYam = 1; // 0001 (wants rice)
    let uniqueItems = hasRice ^ wantsOnlyYam;
    console.log(uniqueItems); // 4 (items only one has)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: You have rice and yam, but the customer only wants rice. `^` finds what’s unique (yam in this case).

#### **4. Bitwise NOT (~)**
- **Explanation**: Flips all bits (0 to 1, 1 to 0). For a 32-bit signed integer, it’s equivalent to `-(x + 1)`.
- **Example from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = ~5;
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `5` in binary is `00000000000000000000000000000101`.
    - `~5` flips to `11111111111111111111111111111010` (decimal `-6`).
    - `let x = ~5;` assigns `-6` to `x`.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let itemsInStock = 5; // 0101
    let noStock = ~itemsInStock;
    console.log(noStock); // -6
    ```
    - **Explanation**: If `5` means you have certain items in stock, `~` flips it to represent the opposite, but in JavaScript’s 32-bit system, it gives a negative number.

#### **5. Bitwise Shift Operators (<<, >>, >>>)**
- **Explanation**: These shift bits left or right, adding zeros or copying the sign bit:
  - `<<` (Left Shift): Moves bits left, adding zeros on the right.
  - `>>` (Signed Right Shift): Moves bits right, copying the leftmost bit.
  - `>>>` (Unsigned Right Shift): Moves bits right, adding zeros on the left.
- **Relatable Analogy**: Imagine sliding items on a market stall table to the left or right, filling empty spaces with new items (zeros).
- **Examples from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5 << 1; // 10
  let y = -5 >> 1; // -3
  let z = 5 >>> 1; // 2
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `5 << 1`: `0101` becomes `1010` (decimal `10`).
    - `-5 >> 1`: `11111111111111111111111111111011` becomes `11111111111111111111111111111101` (decimal `-3`).
    - `5 >>> 1`: `0101` becomes `0010` (decimal `2`).
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let price = 5; // 0101
    let doubledPrice = price << 1;
    console.log(doubledPrice); // 10 (like doubling the price)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Shifting left is like doubling the price of items in a market by moving their “value” left in binary.

#### **6. Bitwise Assignment Operators (&=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=, >>>=)**
- **Explanation**: These combine bitwise operations with assignment, updating the variable directly.
- **Examples from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  x &= 5; // x becomes 0
  x |= 5; // x becomes 5
  x ^= 5; // x becomes 0
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `x &= 5`: `10 & 5 = 00001010 & 00000101 = 00000000` (0).
    - `x |= 5`: `0 | 5 = 00000000 | 00000101 = 00000101` (5).
    - `x ^= 5`: `5 ^ 5 = 00000101 ^ 00000101 = 00000000` (0).
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let stock = 10; // 00001010
    stock &= 5; // 00001010 & 00000101 = 00000000
    console.log(stock); // 0 (no matching items)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: You have items in stock (`10`), and the customer wants certain items (`5`). `&=` checks what you both have, updating `stock`.

#### **7. Converting Decimal to Binary and Vice Versa**
- **Explanation**: The lesson provides functions to convert numbers to binary strings and back:
  - `dec2bin`: Converts a decimal to a binary string.
  - `bin2dec`: Converts a binary string to a decimal.
- **Examples from Lesson Note**:
  ```javascript
  function dec2bin(dec) {
    return (dec >>> 0).toString(2);
  }
  function bin2dec(bin) {
    return parseInt(bin, 2).toString(10);
  }
  ```
  - **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
    - `dec2bin(dec)`:
      - `(dec >>> 0)` ensures the number is treated as an unsigned 32-bit integer.
      - `.toString(2)` converts it to a binary string (base 2).
    - `bin2dec(bin)`:
      - `parseInt(bin, 2)` parses the binary string as a base-2 number.
      - `.toString(10)` converts it to a decimal string.
  - **Beginner-Friendly Example**:
    ```javascript
    let naira = 13;
    let binaryNaira = dec2bin(naira);
    console.log(binaryNaira); // "1101" (8 + 4 + 1 = 13)
    let decimalBack = bin2dec("1101");
    console.log(decimalBack); // "13"
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Imagine converting the price of an item (13 naira) to a binary code for a market app, then back to naira for display.

## **Section 2 – Class Exercise**

**Exercise: Build a “Market Stall Stock Checker”**

This exercise uses **bitwise operations** and **number properties** to create a program that checks what items a market vendor and customer both want, making it fun and relatable for Nigerian students.

- **Objective**: Use bitwise operations to check which items a vendor and customer both have/want, and use number properties to validate inputs.
- **Why It’s Boast-Worthy**: Students can show off a program that feels like managing a real market stall, like in Oshodi or Balogun market.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**:
  1. Create variables for the vendor’s stock and customer’s wants, using numbers to represent items (e.g., `1` for rice, `2` for beans, `4` for yam, so `5` means rice and yam).
  2. Use the bitwise `&` operator to find common items.
  3. Use `Number.isInteger()` to check if the inputs are valid whole numbers.
  4. Use `Number.isFinite()` to ensure the inputs aren’t too large or invalid.
  5. Print a message like: “We both have rice and yam!” or “No matching items.”
  6. Test with inputs like `5 & 1` (rice) or `5 & 2` (beans).
- **Example Starter Code** (not the full solution):
  ```javascript
  let vendorStock = 5; // rice (1) + yam (4)
  let customerWants = 1; // rice
  if (Number.isInteger(vendorStock) && Number.isFinite(vendorStock)) {
    let commonItems = vendorStock & customerWants;
    console.log("Common items: " + commonItems);
  } else {
    console.log("Invalid stock input!");
  }
  ```
- **Connection to Lesson**: This uses `&` from bitwise operations and `Number.isInteger()` and `Number.isFinite()` from number properties, reinforcing both concepts.
- **Challenge**: Add a check to see if the result is `0` (no common items) and print a friendly message.

## **Section 3 – Weekly Project**

**Project: Create a “Danfo Passenger Counter”**

This project combines **number properties** and **bitwise operations** to build a program that tracks passengers in a danfo bus, ensuring accurate counts and flagging errors, like trying to count too many people.

- **Objective**: Create a program that:
  1. Tracks the number of passengers in a danfo using `BigInt` for large counts.
  2. Uses bitwise operations to assign seats (e.g., `1` for front seat, `2` for middle, `4` for back).
  3. Validates inputs using number properties like `isSafeInteger()` and `isFinite()`.
  4. Outputs messages like: “The bus has 9999999999999999 passengers in the front seat!”
- **Why It’s Boast-Worthy**: Students can brag about building a program that feels like managing a real Lagos danfo, impressing friends with a practical tool.
- **Detailed Project Brief**:
  - **Milestone 1: Input Passenger Count**
    - Ask the user for the number of passengers (e.g., using `prompt()`).
    - Convert the input to a `BigInt` to handle large numbers.
    - Use `Number.isFinite()` to check if the input is valid.
  - **Milestone 2: Assign Seats with Bitwise Operations**
    - Use numbers to represent seat sections (e.g., `1` for front, `2` for middle, `4` for back).
    - Use `|` to combine seat assignments (e.g., `3` means front and middle).
    - Use `&` to check which seats are occupied.
  - **Milestone 3: Validate and Output**
    - Check if the passenger count is a safe integer using `Number.isSafeInteger()`.
    - If the count exceeds `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, warn the user that `BigInt` is being used.
    - Print a message like: “The danfo has [count] passengers in [seats].”
  - **Milestone 4: Extension**
    - Add a feature to convert the passenger count to binary using the `dec2bin` function from the lesson.
    - Display the binary representation for fun (e.g., “Passenger count in binary: 1101”).
- **Example Starter Code** (not the full solution):
  ```javascript
  let passengerCount = BigInt(prompt("Enter number of passengers:"));
  if (Number.isFinite(Number(passengerCount))) {
    let seats = 3; // front (1) + middle (2)
    let frontSeat = seats & 1; // check if front seat is included
    console.log("Front seat occupied: " + (frontSeat ? "Yes" : "No"));
  } else {
    console.log("Invalid passenger count!");
  }
  ```
- **Connection to Lesson**: Uses `BigInt` for large numbers, `Number.isFinite()` and `Number.isSafeInteger()` for validation, and `&` and `|` for seat assignments.
- **Why It’s Fun**: Students can imagine running a danfo business and showing off their program to friends, saying, “I built a passenger counter for Lagos buses!”
