#### Favorite Books Page (`books.html`)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Favorite Books</title>
    <style>
        table, th, td {
            border: 1px solid black;
            border-collapse: collapse;
        }

</html>
```

### Explanation of the Solution

**Overview**: The exercise is like creating a single page in a library catalog, displaying a table of favorite books. The table is a grid, like a spreadsheet, with a caption as the title, headers as column labels, and data as book details. CSS adds borders and padding for clarity, and a comment acts as a hidden note for organization, ensuring the code is easy to understand.

**Step-by-Step Instructions to Set Up**:
1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad or TextEdit).
2. Create a new file and copy the code for `books.html`.
3. Save as `books.html` with UTF-8 encoding in a folder (e.g., `books-website`).
4. Double-click `books.html` to open in a browser and test the table, caption, and styling.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown (for `books.html`)**:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`:
  - **Purpose**: Declares the document as HTML5 for proper browser rendering.
  - **Metaphor**: Like a label on a catalog, signaling it’s an HTML5 page.
  - **Output**: No visible output, but ensures correct rendering.
  - **Common Error**: Omitting this causes "quirks mode," leading to display issues.
    - **Fix**: Always include at the top.

- `<html lang="en">`:
  - **Purpose**: The root element, wrapping all content, with `lang="en"` for accessibility (e.g., screen readers).
  - **Metaphor**: The catalog’s cover, holding all pages together.
  - **Output**: No visible output, but sets up the structure.
  - **Common Error**: Missing `lang` reduces accessibility.
    - **Fix**: Include `lang="en"`.

- `<head>`:
  - **Purpose**: Contains metadata, including the page title and CSS styles.
  - **Metaphor**: The catalog’s title page, providing context and styling rules.
  - **Output**: Affects browser behavior (tab title, table appearance).

- `<title>Favorite Books</title>`:
  - **Purpose**: Sets the browser tab title, important for SEO and user clarity.
  - **Output**: Browser tab displays "Favorite Books."
  - **Visual Cue**: Title appears in the tab, toolbar, and favorites.
  - **Common Error**: Missing `<title>` shows a blank tab or file path.
    - **Fix**: Include a descriptive title.
  - **Common Error**: Vague title (e.g., "Books"): Poor SEO.
    - **Fix**: Use specific text (e.g., "Favorite Books").

- `<style>`:
  - **Purpose**: Defines CSS for table styling.
  - **Metaphor**: A decorating guide for the table’s appearance.
  - **Output**: Applies borders and padding to the table.

- `table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse; }`:
  - **Purpose**: Adds single black borders to table, headers, and cells.
  - **Output**: Displays a table with clear grid lines.
  - **Visual Cue**: Single black lines around cells; no double borders.
  - **Common Error**: Missing `border-collapse`: Double borders appear.
    - **Fix**: Include `border-collapse: collapse`.

- `th, td { padding: 10px; }`:
  - **Purpose**: Adds 10px space inside cells for readability.
  - **Output**: Text in cells is spaced from borders.
  - **Visual Cue**: Text doesn’t touch cell edges.
  - **Common Error**: Missing units (e.g., `padding: 10`): Ignored.
    - **Fix**: Use `px`.

- `<body>`:
  - **Purpose**: Contains visible content (heading, table, comment).
  - **Metaphor**: The catalog’s pages where content is displayed.
  - **Output**: Displays content in the browser window.

- `<!-- Main title -->`:
  - **Purpose**: Documents the title section for clarity.
  - **Output**: Invisible in the browser, visible in "View Page Source."
  - **Common Error**: Missing `-->` hides unintended content.
    - **Fix**: Ensure `<!--` and `-->` are paired.

- `<h1>My Favorite Books</h1>`:
  - **Purpose**: Displays the main heading.
  - **Output**: Shows "My Favorite Books" in large, bold text.
  - **Visual Cue**: Large, bold text at the top.
  - **Common Error**: Missing closing `</h1>`: May disrupt layout.
    - **Fix**: Ensure tags are closed.

- `<table style="width:100%">`:
  - **Purpose**: Creates a table spanning the page width.
  - **Output**: Table stretches across the page.
  - **Visual Cue**: Wide table filling the browser width.
  - **Common Error**: Missing `%` in `width`: Ignored.
    - **Fix**: Use `width:100%`.

- `<caption>Book List</caption>`:
  - **Purpose**: Adds a title above the table.
  - **Output**: Shows "Book List" above the table, typically centered.
  - **Visual Cue**: Caption above the grid.
  - **Common Error**: `<caption>` not after `<table>`: May not display.
    - **Fix**: Place immediately after `<table>`.

- `<tr><th>Title</th><th>Author</th><th>Year</th></tr>`:
  - **Purpose**: Defines header row with three columns.
  - **Output**: Shows "Title," "Author," "Year" in bold, centered text.
  - **Visual Cue**: Bold, centered headers.
  - **Common Error**: Using `<td>` instead of `<th>`: No bold/centering.
    - **Fix**: Use `<th>` for headers.

- `<tr><td>1984</td><td>George Orwell</td><td>1949</td></tr>`:
  - **Purpose**: Adds first data row.
  - **Output**: Shows book data below headers.
  - **Visual Cue**: Normal text, left-aligned.
  - **Common Error**: Uneven cell count: Misaligned table.
    - **Fix**: Ensure three `<td>` per `<tr>`.

- `<tr><td>Pride and Prejudice</td><td>Jane Austen</td><td>1813</td></tr>`:
  - **Purpose**: Adds second data row.
  - **Output**: Shows second book’s data.
  - **Visual Cue**: Matches first row’s alignment.
  - **Common Error**: Missing closing `</td>`: Layout issues.
    - **Fix**: Close all tags.

- `<!-- <p>Draft: Add more books later.</p> -->`:
  - **Purpose**: Hides a draft note for future use.
  - **Output**: Invisible in the browser.
  - **Common Error**: Incorrect comment syntax: Content may display.
    - **Fix**: Use `<!-- -->` correctly.

**Expected Output in Browser** (for `books.html`):
- Browser tab: "Favorite Books."
- Page content:
  ```
  My Favorite Books [large, bold text]
  Book List [caption above table]
  +-----------------+------------------+--------+
  | Title           | Author           | Year   |
  +-----------------+------------------+--------+
  | 1984            | George Orwell    | 1949   |
  | Pride and Prejudice | Jane Austen   | 1813   |
  +-----------------+------------------+--------+
  ```
- Table has single black borders, 10px padding, and spans page width.

**Side Effects**: None (static HTML displays table and text).

**Visual Cues**:
- Table shows a clear grid with borders and padded cells.
- Caption appears above the table.
- Headers are bold and centered; data is left-aligned.
- Comment is invisible in the browser.

**How to Test**:
1. Save `books.html` in a folder (e.g., `books-website`).
2. Open in a browser by double-clicking.
3. Verify:
   - Browser tab shows "Favorite Books."
   - Table displays with caption, headers, two data rows, borders, and padding.
   - Comment is invisible but visible in "View Page Source."
4. Use a screen reader (if available) to confirm the caption and table are read aloud.

**Common Errors and Troubleshooting**:
- **Error**: Table misaligned.
  - **Cause**: Uneven cell counts in rows.
    - **Fix**: Ensure each `<tr>` has three cells.
- **Error**: Double borders appear.
  - **Cause**: Missing `border-collapse`.
    - **Fix**: Include `border-collapse: collapse`.
- **Error**: Caption not visible.
  - **Cause**: `<caption>` not after `<table>`.
    - **Fix**: Place `<caption>` first in `<table>`.
- **Error**: Page shows code.
  - **Cause**: Saved as `.txt`.
    - **Fix**: Save as `.html`.
- **Error**: No padding or borders.
  - **Cause**: Incorrect CSS syntax.
    - **Fix**: Check selectors and properties (e.g., `padding: 10px;`).

**Validation Checks**:
- Confirm file starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and includes `<html lang="en">`.
- Check browser tab for the correct title.
- Verify table displays with caption, borders, padding, and three columns.
- Ensure headers are bold and centered.
- Confirm comment is hidden in the browser.
- Test with a screen reader for accessibility.

**Metaphor for the Whole Process**: Creating this webpage is like designing a page in a library catalog. The table is a grid listing books, with a caption as the title, headers as labels, and CSS as decoration, all viewable in a browser.
