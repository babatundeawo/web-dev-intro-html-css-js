## Section 1 — Topical Explanations

This section explains the key concepts from the HTML File Paths lesson, including file paths, relative file paths (same folder, subfolder, root folder, parent folder), absolute file paths, and best practices for using relative paths. Each concept includes step-by-step code analysis, expected outputs, visual cues, common errors, and validation checks, using everyday metaphors for accessibility.

### Concept 1: File Paths Overview

**Explanation**: A file path specifies the location of a file in a website’s folder structure, like giving directions to a file’s address in a digital filing cabinet. File paths are used to link to external resources such as images, stylesheets, or JavaScript files.

- **Key Points**:
  - Used in tags like `<img>`, `<link>`, `<script>`.
  - Two types: relative (relative to current page) and absolute (full URL).
- **Metaphor**: A file path is like a map to find a book in a library.

### Concept 2: Relative File Paths (Same Folder)

**Explanation**: A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page’s location, like finding a file in the same room.

- **Key Points**:
  - Syntax: `filename.ext` (e.g., `picture.jpg`).
  - File is in the same folder as the HTML file.
- **Metaphor**: Like picking up a book from the same shelf you’re standing by.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<img src="picture.jpg" alt="Picture">
```

- **Purpose**: Displays an image in the same folder as the HTML file.
- **Inputs**: Image file `picture.jpg` in the same folder.
- **Outputs**: Displays the image.
- **Visual Cues**: Image appears in the browser.
- **Common Errors**:
  - File missing: Broken image icon.
    - **Fix**: Ensure `picture.jpg` exists in the same folder.
  - Incorrect case (e.g., `Picture.jpg`): File not found on case-sensitive servers.
    - **Fix**: Match filename exactly.
- **Validation Check**: Save as `same.html` with `picture.jpg` in the same folder, open in a browser, confirm image displays.

### Concept 3: Relative File Paths (Subfolder)

**Explanation**: Points to a file in a folder inside the current folder, like finding a book in a drawer within the same room.

- **Key Points**:
  - Syntax: `folder/filename.ext` (e.g., `images/picture.jpg`).
  - File is in a subfolder of the current folder.
- **Metaphor**: Like opening a box on your shelf to find a book.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Picture">
```

- **Purpose**: Displays an image in the `images` subfolder.
- **Outputs**: Displays the image.
- **Visual Cues**: Image appears.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Missing subfolder: Broken image.
    - **Fix**: Create `images` folder with `picture.jpg`.
  - Wrong folder name: File not found.
    - **Fix**: Match folder name exactly.
- **Validation Check**: Save as `subfolder.html` with `picture.jpg` in an `images` subfolder, confirm image displays.

### Concept 4: Relative File Paths (Root Folder)

**Explanation**: Points to a file in a folder at the website’s root, like finding a book in the library’s main section.

- **Key Points**:
  - Syntax: `/folder/filename.ext` (e.g., `/images/picture.jpg`).
  - Starts with `/` to indicate the root.
- **Metaphor**: Like going to the library’s front desk to find a book.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Picture">
```

- **Purpose**: Displays an image in the `images` folder at the website’s root.
- **Outputs**: Displays the image.
- **Visual Cues**: Image appears.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Wrong root path: File not found.
    - **Fix**: Ensure `images` folder is at the root.
  - Local testing without server: Root paths may fail.
    - **Fix**: Test on a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).
- **Validation Check**: Save as `root.html` with `picture.jpg` in a root-level `images` folder, test on a server, confirm image displays.

### Concept 5: Relative File Paths (Parent Folder)

**Explanation**: Points to a file in a folder one level up, like finding a book in the room next door.

- **Key Points**:
  - Syntax: `../filename.ext` (e.g., `../picture.jpg`).
  - `../` moves up one folder.
- **Metaphor**: Like stepping out of your room to grab a book from the hallway.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<img src="../picture.jpg" alt="Picture">
```

- **Purpose**: Displays an image in the parent folder.
- **Outputs**: Displays the image.
- **Visual Cues**: Image appears.
- **Common Errors**:
  - File not in parent folder: Broken image.
    - **Fix**: Place `picture.jpg` in the parent folder.
  - Too many `../`: Wrong directory.
    - **Fix**: Use correct number of `../`.
- **Validation Check**: Save as `parent.html` in a subfolder with `picture.jpg` in the parent folder, confirm image displays.

### Concept 6: Absolute File Paths

**Explanation**: An absolute file path is the full URL to a file, like providing a complete address with city and country.

- **Key Points**:
  - Syntax: `https://domain/path/filename.ext`.
  - Used for external resources.
- **Metaphor**: Like mailing a letter with a full address.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
```

- **Purpose**: Displays an image from a URL.
- **Outputs**: Displays the image.
- **Visual Cues**: Image appears.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Invalid URL: Broken image.
    - **Fix**: Verify URL.
  - No internet: Image fails to load.
    - **Fix**: Ensure internet connection.
- **Validation Check**: Save as `absolute.html`, confirm image displays with internet.

### Concept 7: Best Practice (Use Relative Paths)

**Explanation**: Relative paths are preferred because they work across environments (local, public domains) without hardcoding URLs, like using a local map instead of a global one.

- **Key Points**:
  - Relative paths are portable.
  - Avoid absolute paths for local files.
- **Metaphor**: Like using directions from your current location instead of a full address.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Picture">
```

- **Purpose**: Uses relative path for portability.
- **Outputs**: Displays image if in `images` folder.
- **Visual Cues**: Image appears.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Using absolute path locally: Fails on other servers.
    - **Fix**: Use relative path.
- **Validation Check**: Test across local and server environments.

## Section 2 — Class Exercise

This exercise helps you practice using relative file paths to link images.

**Theme**: Create a webpage displaying two images using relative file paths (one in the same folder, one in a subfolder).

**Objectives**:
- Use `<img>` with relative file paths.
- Include a heading and comment.
- Save and view in a browser.

**Stepwise Instructions**:
1. Create a folder (e.g., `image-gallery`).
2. Add two images: `photo1.jpg` in the main folder, `photo2.jpg` in an `images` subfolder.
3. Open a text editor and create an HTML file with:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <title>Image Gallery</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
4. In `<body>`, add:
   - An `<h1>` (e.g., "My Image Gallery").
   - An `<img>` for `photo1.jpg` (same folder).
   - An `<img>` for `photo2.jpg` (in `images` subfolder).
   - A comment to document one image.
5. Save as `gallery.html` in `image-gallery`, open in a browser.

**Hints**:
- Use `src="photo1.jpg"` and `src="images/photo2.jpg"`.
- Include `alt` attributes for accessibility.
- Ensure images exist in the correct folders.

**Checkpoints**:
- Do both images display?
- Is the comment invisible?
- Does the page render correctly?

## Section 3 — Weekly Project

This project combines relative file paths with prior lessons (e.g., `class`, `id`, JavaScript) to create a two-page website about a travel guide.

**Project Brief**: Build a two-page website: a homepage with two images (one in a subfolder, one in a parent folder) styled with a `class` and one with an `id`, and a Details page with a JavaScript button to change an image’s `src` using a relative path, linked for navigation.

**Milestones**:
1. **Homepage (`index.html`)**:
   - Include a `<title>` (e.g., "Travel Guide").
   - Add two `<img>` elements with relative paths (e.g., `images/destination.jpg`, `../map.jpg`), one with `class="photo"`, one with `id="featured"`.
   - Apply CSS in `<style>`: `.photo` for border, `#featured` for size.
   - Include an `<h1>`, an `<a>` to `details.html`, and a comment.
2. **Details Page (`details.html`)**:
   - Include a `<title>` (e.g., "Travel Details").
   - Add an `<img>` with `id="placeImage"` and a relative path (e.g., `images/place.jpg`), a `<button>` to change `src` to another image (e.g., `images/place2.jpg`), an `<h1>`, a `<script>`, and an `<a>` back to `index.html`.
   - Include a comment.
3. **Testing**:
   - Create a folder (e.g., `travel-guide`) with subfolder `images` (containing `destination.jpg`, `place.jpg`, `place2.jpg`) and a parent folder with `map.jpg`.
   - Save both files and test in a browser for image display, styling, JavaScript, and navigation.

**Success Metrics**:
- Homepage shows two styled images with correct paths.
- Details page changes image on button click.
- Navigation links work.
- Comments are invisible.

**Research Prompts**:
- Explore file path resolution in web servers.
- Research image optimization for web.

**Extension Ideas**:
- Add a `<ul>` navigation menu from prior lessons.
- Include a favicon.

## Completion Checklist

- **Learning Goals**:
  - Use relative and absolute file paths.
  - Link images with `<img>` and apply `class`/`id` styling.
  - Use JavaScript to change `src`.
  - Include navigation and comments.
- **Runnable Example**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Travel Guide</title>
    <style>
        .photo {
            border: 2px solid black;
        }
        #featured {
            width: 300px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Main title -->
    <h1>Travel Guide</h1>
    <img src="images/destination.jpg" alt="Destination" class="photo">
    <img src="../map.jpg" alt="Map" class="photo" id="featured">
    <p><a href="details.html">Travel Details</a></p>
    <!-- <p>Draft: Add more images.</p> --> <!-- Hidden draft -->
</body>
</html>
```

- Save as `index.html` in a folder (e.g., `travel-guide/subfolder`) with `destination.jpg` in `travel-guide/subfolder/images` and `map.jpg` in `travel-guide`. Create a `details.html` with a `<title>`, `<img>` with `id="placeImage"`, `<button>` to change `src`, `<script>`, `<h1>`, link back to `index.html`, and a comment.
- **Checklist for Completion**:
  - [ ] Files start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and include `<html lang="en">`.
  - [ ] Use relative paths, `class`, `id`, and JavaScript.
  - [ ] Apply CSS for `.photo` and `#featured`.
  - [ ] Include navigation and comments.
  - [ ] Images display, JavaScript works, navigation functions.
  - [ ] Saved as `.html` with images in correct folders.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Incorrect file paths causing broken images.
  - Missing files or folders.
  - Case mismatch in filenames.
  - JavaScript errors from incorrect `id`.
  - Missing navigation files.
- **One-Line Summary**: HTML file paths enable linking to images and resources using relative paths for portability, enhanced with CSS and JavaScript, viewable in a browser after saving as HTML files with correct folder structure.
