### Solution Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>My Favorite Book: To Kill a Mockingbird</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: blue;
            font-family: arial;
            font-size: 200%;
        }
        p {
            color: green;
            font-family: times;
            font-size: 120%;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Book title with inline background color -->
    <h1 style="background-color:lightgray;">To Kill a Mockingbird</h1>
    <!-- Book description -->
    <p>This novel by Harper Lee explores justice and morality in a small town.</p>
    <!-- Favorite quote -->
    <p>"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view."</p>
    <!-- <p>Draft: Add author bio.</p> --> <!-- Hidden draft content -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of the Solution

**Overview**: The exercise is like decorating a scrapbook page about a favorite book, "To Kill a Mockingbird." The title gets a special background color (like a highlighted sticker), while the description and quote are styled consistently with internal CSS, like choosing a theme for all text entries. Comments document the sections, ensuring clarity for future edits.

**Step-by-Step Instructions to Set Up**:
1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad or TextEdit).
2. Copy the code above into a new file.
3. Save as `book.html` with UTF-8 encoding.
4. Double-click the file to open in a browser and verify the content, styles, and comments display correctly.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`:
  - **Purpose**: Declares the document as HTML5, ensuring proper browser rendering.
  - **Metaphor**: Like a label on a scrapbook, signaling it’s an HTML5 page.
  - **Output**: No visible output, but ensures correct rendering.
  - **Common Error**: Omitting this causes "quirks mode," leading to display issues.
    - **Fix**: Always include at the top.

- `<html lang="en">`:
  - **Purpose**: The root element, wrapping all content, with `lang="en"` for accessibility (e.g., screen readers).
  - **Metaphor**: The scrapbook’s cover, holding all content together.
  - **Output**: No visible output, but sets up the page structure.
  - **Common Error**: Missing `lang` reduces accessibility.
    - **Fix**: Include `lang="en"`.

- `<head>`:
  - **Purpose**: Contains metadata, like the title and internal CSS.
  - **Metaphor**: The scrapbook’s title page, providing context and styling rules.
  - **Output**: Affects browser behavior (e.g., tab title, styles).

- `<title>My Favorite Book: To Kill a Mockingbird</title>`:
  - **Purpose**: Sets the browser tab title.
  - **Output**: Browser tab displays "My Favorite Book: To Kill a Mockingbird."
  - **Common Error**: Missing `<title>` shows a blank tab or file path.
    - **Fix**: Include a descriptive title.

- `<style>`:
  - **Purpose**: Defines internal CSS rules for the page.
  - **Metaphor**: A decorating guide for all similar elements in the scrapbook.
  - **Output**: Applies styles to matching elements (`h1`, `p`).

- `h1 {color: blue; font-family: arial; font-size: 200%;}`:
  - **Purpose**: Styles all `<h1>` elements with blue text, Arial font, and 200% size.
  - **Output**: Heading text is blue, in Arial, twice the default size.
  - **Common Error**: Misspelling `arial` (e.g., `ariel`): Default font used.
    - **Fix**: Use valid font names (e.g., `arial`).

- `p {color: green; font-family: times; font-size: 120%;}`:
  - **Purpose**: Styles all `<p>` elements with green text, Times font, and 120% size.
  - **Output**: Paragraphs are green, in Times, slightly larger than default.
  - **Common Error**: Missing semicolon (e.g., `color: green`): Subsequent styles ignored.
    - **Fix**: Include semicolons after each property-value pair.

- `<body>`:
  - **Purpose**: Contains all visible content (heading, paragraphs, comment).
  - **Metaphor**: The scrapbook’s pages where the book’s story is displayed.
  - **Output**: Displays all content in the browser window.

- `<!-- Book title with inline background color -->`:
  - **Purpose**: Documents the title section for clarity.
  - **Output**: Invisible in the browser, visible in "View Page Source."
  - **Common Error**: Missing `-->` hides unintended content.
    - **Fix**: Ensure `<!--` and `-->` are paired.

- `<h1 style="background-color:lightgray;">To Kill a Mockingbird</h1>`:
  - **Purpose**: Displays the book title with a light gray background using inline CSS.
  - **Attributes**:
    - `style="background-color:lightgray;"`: Sets a light gray background.
  - **Output**: Shows "To Kill a Mockingbird" in large, bold, blue text (from internal CSS) on a light gray background.
  - **Visual Cue**: Large, bold blue text with a gray background filling the heading area.
  - **Common Error**: Misspelling `lightgray` (e.g., `lightgrey`): No background color.
    - **Fix**: Use exact color name (`lightgray`).

- `<!-- Book description -->`:
  - **Purpose**: Documents the description section.
  - **Output**: Invisible in the browser.

- `<p>This novel by Harper Lee explores justice and morality in a small town.</p>`:
  - **Purpose**: Describes the book, styled by internal CSS.
  - **Output**: Shows the paragraph in green, Times font, 120% size.
  - **Visual Cue**: Normal text in green, with paragraph spacing.
  - **Common Error**: Placing `<p>` outside `<body>`: May not display.
    - **Fix**: Ensure content is inside `<body>`.

- `<!-- Favorite quote -->`:
  - **Purpose**: Documents the quote section.
  - **Output**: Invisible in the browser.

- `<p>"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view."</p>`:
  - **Purpose**: Displays a quote, styled by internal CSS.
  - **Output**: Shows the quote in green, Times font, 120% size.
  - **Visual Cue**: Quote in green, with paragraph spacing.
  - **Common Error**: Missing closing `</p>`: May disrupt page layout.
    - **Fix**: Ensure tags are closed.

- `<!-- <p>Draft: Add author bio.</p> -->`:
  - **Purpose**: Hides a draft paragraph for future use.
  - **Output**: Invisible in the browser.
  - **Common Error**: Incorrect comment syntax (e.g., `<!-`): Content may display.
    - **Fix**: Use `<!-- -->` correctly.

**Expected Output in Browser**:
- Browser tab: "My Favorite Book: To Kill a Mockingbird"
- Page content:
  ```
  To Kill a Mockingbird [large, bold, blue text on a light gray background]
  This novel by Harper Lee explores justice and morality in a small town. [green, Times font, 120% size]
  "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view." [green, Times font, 120% size]
  ```

**Side Effects**: None (static HTML displays content without modifying anything).

**Visual Cues**:
- `<h1>` is large, bold, blue, with a light gray background.
- Paragraphs are green, in Times font, slightly larger than default.
- Comments are invisible in the browser but visible in "View Page Source."

**How to Test**:
1. Save the code as `book.html`.
2. Open in a browser by double-clicking.
3. Verify:
   - The tab shows "My Favorite Book: To Kill a Mockingbird."
   - Heading is blue with a light gray background, in Arial, 200% size.
   - Paragraphs are green, in Times, 120% size.
   - Comments are invisible in the browser but appear in "View Page Source."
4. Use a screen reader (if available) to confirm accessibility.

**Common Errors and Troubleshooting**:
- **Error**: Styles don’t apply.
  - **Cause**: Misspelled properties (e.g., `colour`) or color names (e.g., `lightgrey`).
    - **Fix**: Use correct property names (`color`) and color names (`lightgray`).
- **Error**: Internal CSS doesn’t work.
  - **Cause**: `<style>` outside `<head>` or missing curly braces.
    - **Fix**: Place `<style>` in `<head>` and use `{property: value;}`.
- **Error**: Page shows code.
  - **Cause**: Saved as `.txt` instead of `.html`.
    - **Fix**: Save with `.html` extension.
- **Error**: Comments visible in browser.
  - **Cause**: Incorrect comment syntax (e.g., missing `-->`).
    - **Fix**: Ensure `<!--` and `-->` are paired.
- **Error**: Fonts don’t display as expected.
  - **Cause**: Invalid `font-family` (e.g., `ariel`).
    - **Fix**: Use valid fonts (e.g., `arial`, `times`).

**Validation Checks**:
- Confirm the file starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and includes `<html lang="en">`.
- Check the browser tab for the correct title.
- Verify `background-color`, `color`, `font-family`, and `font-size` display correctly.
- Ensure comments are hidden in the browser.
- Confirm inline CSS (for `<h1>`) and internal CSS (for `<h1>`, `<p>`) are used.

**Metaphor for the Whole Process**: Creating this webpage is like decorating a scrapbook page about a favorite book. The title is a bold, highlighted heading, the description and quote are written in a consistent style, like choosing a single pen color and font for all entries. Comments are hidden notes for the scrapbook’s creator, keeping the page organized for future additions.
