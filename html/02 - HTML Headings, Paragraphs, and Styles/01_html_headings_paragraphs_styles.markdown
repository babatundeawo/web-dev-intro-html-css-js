## Section 1 — Topical Explanations

This section explains the key concepts from the HTML lesson, breaking down each element and attribute with step-by-step code analysis, expected outputs, visual cues, common errors, and validation checks. Concepts are introduced using everyday metaphors to make them accessible to beginners.

### Concept 1: HTML Headings

**Explanation**: HTML headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) are like the titles and subtitles in a book, organizing content by importance. `<h1>` is the most important (like a chapter title), and `<h6>` is the least (like a minor subheading). They help browsers, search engines, and users understand the page’s structure.

- **Key Points**:
  - Defined with `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.
  - `<h1>` is the largest and most important; `<h6>` is the smallest.
  - Browsers add margins (white space) before and after headings automatically.
  - Use headings for structure, not just to make text big or bold.
- **Metaphor**: Headings are like signs on a highway, guiding users to key sections of your webpage.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1> <!-- Largest, most important heading -->
<h2>Heading 2</h2> <!-- Slightly smaller, secondary heading -->
<h3>Heading 3</h3> <!-- Smaller, tertiary heading -->
<h4>Heading 4</h4> <!-- Even smaller -->
<h5>Heading 5</h5> <!-- Smaller still -->
<h6>Heading 6</h6> <!-- Smallest, least important heading -->
```

- **Purpose**: Displays headings of varying importance and size.
- **Inputs**: None (static HTML).
- **Outputs**: Six headings, decreasing in size from `<h1>` (largest, boldest) to `<h6>` (smallest).
- **Side Effects**: None (just displays text).
- **Expected Output in Browser**:
  ```
  Heading 1
  Heading 2
  Heading 3
  Heading 4
  Heading 5
  Heading 6
  ```
- **Visual Cues**: `<h1>` is the largest and boldest, `<h6>` is the smallest, with automatic spacing above and below each heading.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Using multiple `<h1>` tags on one page: Confuses search engines and accessibility tools.
    - **Fix**: Use one `<h1>` per page for the main title, followed by `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc., for subheadings.
  - Using headings for styling (e.g., to make text big): Misleads users and search engines.
    - **Fix**: Use the `style` attribute or CSS for styling.
- **Validation Check**: Save as `headings.html`, open in a browser, and confirm headings display in decreasing sizes with proper spacing.

### Concept 2: HTML Paragraphs

**Explanation**: Paragraphs (`<p>`) are like blocks of text in a letter, presenting content in a readable format. They start on a new line with automatic margins for spacing.

- **Key Points**:
  - Defined with the `<p>` tag.
  - Browsers ignore extra spaces or lines in the code, displaying paragraphs cleanly.
  - Use for regular text content, not for formatting spaces or breaks.
- **Metaphor**: Paragraphs are like paragraphs in a story, breaking text into manageable chunks for readers.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- First paragraph -->
<p>This is another paragraph.</p> <!-- Second paragraph -->
<p>
  This paragraph
  contains a lot of lines
  in the source code,
  but the browser
  ignores it.
</p> <!-- Extra lines/spaces are collapsed -->
```

- **Purpose**: Displays blocks of text as separate paragraphs.
- **Inputs**: None.
- **Outputs**: Each `<p>` appears as a separate block of text, with extra spaces/lines in the code ignored.
- **Expected Output in Browser**:
  ```
  This is a paragraph.
  This is another paragraph.
  This paragraph contains a lot of lines in the source code, but the browser ignores it.
  ```
- **Visual Cues**: Paragraphs are separated by vertical spacing, displayed in the browser’s default font.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Forgetting `</p>`: May cause text to overlap or display incorrectly.
    - **Fix**: Always include closing tags.
  - Adding extra spaces/lines expecting them to show: Browsers collapse them.
    - **Fix**: Use `<br>` for line breaks or `<pre>` for preserving formatting.
- **Validation Check**: Save as `paragraphs.html`, open in a browser, and verify paragraphs are separated with no extra spaces/lines from the code.

### Concept 3: Horizontal Rules and Line Breaks

**Explanation**: The `<hr>` tag creates a horizontal line to separate sections, like a divider in a notebook. The `<br>` tag adds a line break within a paragraph, like pressing "Enter" without starting a new paragraph.

- **Key Points**:
  - `<hr>` is an empty tag (no content or end tag) for thematic breaks.
  - `<br>` is an empty tag for single line breaks within text.
- **Metaphor**: `<hr>` is like a chapter break, and `<br>` is like a soft pause in a sentence.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1> <!-- Main heading -->
<p>This is some text.</p> <!-- Paragraph -->
<hr> <!-- Horizontal line to separate sections -->
<h2>This is heading 2</h2> <!-- Secondary heading -->
<p>This is some other text.</p> <!-- Another paragraph -->
<hr> <!-- Another separator -->
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p> <!-- Paragraph with line breaks -->
```

- **Purpose**: Demonstrates separating content with `<hr>` and adding line breaks with `<br>`.
- **Outputs**:
  ```
  This is heading 1
  This is some text.
  [horizontal line]
  This is heading 2
  This is some other text.
  [horizontal line]
  This is
  a paragraph
  with line breaks.
  ```
- **Visual Cues**: `<hr>` appears as a horizontal line across the page; `<br>` moves text to the next line without extra paragraph spacing.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Using `<hr>` or `<br>` for styling instead of structure: Can confuse page hierarchy.
    - **Fix**: Use `<hr>` for thematic breaks and `<br>` for necessary line breaks only.
  - Adding an end tag to `<hr>` or `<br>` (e.g., `</hr>`): Invalid syntax.
    - **Fix**: These are empty tags; omit end tags.
- **Validation Check**: Save as `hr_br.html`, open in a browser, and confirm horizontal lines appear between sections and line breaks split text within the paragraph.

### Concept 4: Preformatted Text

**Explanation**: The `<pre>` tag is like a typewriter, preserving spaces, line breaks, and formatting exactly as written in the code. It’s ideal for displaying code, poems, or text where layout matters.

- **Key Points**:
  - Uses a fixed-width font (e.g., Courier).
  - Preserves all spaces and line breaks.
- **Metaphor**: `<pre>` is like a photocopy of your text layout, showing exactly what you typed.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre> <!-- Preserves exact formatting -->
```

- **Purpose**: Displays a poem with its original line breaks and spacing.
- **Outputs**:
  ```
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
  ```
- **Visual Cues**: Text appears in a fixed-width font, with all spaces and line breaks preserved.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Using `<pre>` for regular text: Unnecessary and may look out of place.
    - **Fix**: Use `<pre>` only when formatting (e.g., spaces, line breaks) must be preserved.
  - Forgetting `</pre>`: Text may not display correctly.
    - **Fix**: Ensure proper closing tags.
- **Validation Check**: Save as `pre.html`, open in a browser, and confirm the poem’s layout is preserved exactly as written.

### Concept 5: HTML Styles with the `style` Attribute

**Explanation**: The `style` attribute adds visual flair to elements, like choosing paint colors for a room. It uses CSS properties (e.g., `color`, `font-size`) to change appearance.

- **Key Points**:
  - Syntax: `style="property:value;"` (e.g., `style="color:blue;"`).
  - Common properties: `background-color`, `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `text-align`.
- **Metaphor**: The `style` attribute is like decorating a plain poster with colors and fonts.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1> <!-- Blue heading -->
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- Red paragraph -->
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1> <!-- Verdana font -->
<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- Courier font -->
<h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1> <!-- 3x default size -->
<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- 1.6x default size -->
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1> <!-- Centered heading -->
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p> <!-- Centered paragraph -->
<body style="background-color:powderblue;"> <!-- Page background -->
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
```

- **Purpose**: Applies styles to change text color, font, size, alignment, and background color.
- **Outputs**:
  ```
  This is a heading [in blue]
  This is a paragraph. [in red]
  This is a heading [in Verdana font]
  This is a paragraph. [in Courier font]
  This is a heading [3x larger]
  This is a paragraph. [1.6x larger]
  Centered Heading [centered]
  Centered paragraph. [centered]
  [Page with powderblue background]
  This is a heading
  This is a paragraph.
  ```
- **Visual Cues**: Colors, fonts, sizes, and alignment change as specified; background color fills the page or element.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Incorrect CSS syntax (e.g., missing colon or semicolon): Style doesn’t apply.
    - **Fix**: Use `property:value;` (e.g., `color:blue;`).
  - Invalid property/value (e.g., `color:blu`): Ignored by the browser.
    - **Fix**: Use valid CSS properties/values (e.g., `color:blue`).
- **Validation Check**: Save as `styles.html`, open in a browser, and confirm styles (colors, fonts, sizes, alignment) apply correctly.

## Section 2 — Class Exercise

This exercise helps you practice using headings, paragraphs, `<hr>`, `<br>`, `<pre>`, and the `style` attribute to create a structured webpage.

**Theme**: Create a webpage for a favorite book or movie.

**Objectives**:
- Use `<h1>` to `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<hr>`, `<br>`, and `<pre>` elements.
- Apply `style` attributes for color, font, size, or alignment.
- Save and view the page in a browser.

**Stepwise Instructions**:
1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad or TextEdit).
2. Create a new HTML file with the basic structure:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <title>My Favorite Book</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
3. Inside `<body>`, add:
   - An `<h1>` with the book/movie title.
   - An `<h2>` for a section like "Summary" or "Why I Love It."
   - A `<p>` describing the book/movie (e.g., plot or favorite scene).
   - An `<hr>` to separate sections.
   - An `<h3>` for a section like "Favorite Quote."
   - A `<pre>` to display a quote or short poem with preserved formatting.
   - A `<p>` with a line break (`<br>`) to list characters or actors (e.g., "Character 1<br>Character 2").
   - Use the `style` attribute to add at least two styles (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `text-align`).
4. Save as `favorite.html`.
5. Open in a browser to view.

**Hints**:
- Use `style="color:blue;"` to change text color or `style="text-align:center;"` for centering.
- Ensure `<pre>` preserves the exact spacing of your quote.
- Place `<hr>` between sections for visual separation.

**Checkpoints**:
- Does the browser tab show the title?
- Are headings sized appropriately (`<h1>` largest, `<h3>` smaller)?
- Does the `<pre>` text keep its formatting?
- Do styles (e.g., color, alignment) appear correctly?

## Section 3 — Weekly Project

This project combines headings, paragraphs, `<hr>`, `<br>`, `<pre>`, and `style` attributes to create a multi-page fan website for a book, movie, or hobby.

**Project Brief**: Build a two-page website: a homepage and a "Details" page.

**Milestones**:
1. **Homepage (`index.html`)**:
   - Include an `<h1>` for the main title (e.g., "My Star Wars Fan Page").
   - Add a `<p>` with a welcome message.
   - Use `<hr>` to separate sections.
   - Include an `<h2>` and `<p>` for a brief overview.
   - Add a `<pre>` for a formatted quote or text (e.g., a movie quote).
   - Use `style` attributes to customize at least two elements (e.g., `color`, `font-size`).
   - Add a link (`<a href="details.html">`) to the Details page.
2. **Details Page (`details.html`)**:
   - Include an `<h1>` for the page title (e.g., "Star Wars Details").
   - Add an `<h2>` and `<p>` for a section like "Favorite Characters" with `<br>` for a list (e.g., "Luke Skywalker<br>Darth Vader").
   - Use `<hr>` to separate sections.
   - Include an `<h3>` and `<p>` for another section (e.g., "Why It’s Great").
   - Use `style` attributes for at least two elements.
   - Add a link (`<a href="index.html">`) back to the homepage.
3. **Testing**:
   - Save both files in the same folder.
   - Open `index.html` in a browser and test navigation, styles, and formatting.

**Success Metrics**:
- Both pages load correctly with proper titles in the browser tab.
- Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) are sized and structured correctly.
- `<hr>` and `<br>` provide clear separation and breaks.
- `<pre>` preserves text formatting.
- Styles (e.g., color, alignment) are applied correctly.
- Links navigate between pages.

**Research Prompts**:
- Look up additional CSS properties for the `style` attribute (e.g., `font-weight`, `margin`).
- Explore how to find famous quotes or text snippets to use in `<pre>`.

**Extension Ideas**:
- Add a third page for another topic (e.g., "Fan Theories").
- Experiment with more `style` properties, like `background-color` or `font-weight`.
