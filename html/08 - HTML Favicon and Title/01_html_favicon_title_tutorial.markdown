## Section 1 — Topical Explanations

This section explains the key concepts from the HTML Favicon and Title lesson, including the `<link>` tag for favicons and the `<title>` tag for page titles. Each concept includes step-by-step code analysis, expected outputs, visual cues, common errors, and validation checks, using everyday metaphors for accessibility.

### Concept 1: Adding a Favicon with `<link>` Tag

**Explanation**: A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in a browser tab, like a logo on a book cover. The `<link>` tag is used to reference the favicon file (e.g., `favicon.ico`) and is placed in the `<head>` section.

- **Key Points**:
  - Syntax: `<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico">`.
  - `rel="icon"`: Specifies the relationship (favicon).
  - `type="image/x-icon"`: Indicates the file format (e.g., ICO).
  - `href`: Path to the favicon (relative or absolute).
  - Common formats: ICO, PNG, GIF, JPEG, SVG.
  - Place the favicon in the root directory or a subfolder (e.g., `images/`).
- **Metaphor**: The favicon is like a tiny logo on a book’s spine, making it recognizable in a browser tab.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
```

- **Purpose**: Links a favicon to the webpage.
- **Inputs**: `favicon.ico` in the `images` folder.
- **Outputs**: Displays the favicon in the browser tab next to the title.
- **Visual Cues**: Small image (e.g., 16x16 or 32x32 pixels) appears in the tab; if missing, a default browser icon shows.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Wrong `href` path (e.g., `href="favicon.ico"` when file is in `images/`): Favicon doesn’t display.
    - **Fix**: Use correct path (e.g., `href="/images/favicon.ico"`).
  - Incorrect `type` (e.g., `type="image/png"` for ICO): May fail in some browsers.
    - **Fix**: Match `type` to file format (e.g., `image/x-icon` for ICO).
- **Validation Check**: Save as `favicon.html`, place `favicon.ico` in `images/`, open in a browser, and confirm the favicon appears.

### Concept 2: Setting a Page Title with `<title>` Tag

**Explanation**: The `<title>` tag defines the text shown in the browser tab, toolbar, favorites, and search engine results, like a book’s title on its cover. It’s critical for SEO and user clarity.

- **Key Points**:
  - Syntax: `<title>Page Title</title>` in the `<head>`.
  - Should be descriptive and meaningful for SEO and accessibility.
  - Only one `<title>` per page, placed in `<head>`.
- **Metaphor**: The `<title>` is like the title on a book’s cover, telling readers and search engines what the page is about.

**Example Code Breakdown**:

```html
<title>HTML Tutorial</title>
```

- **Purpose**: Sets the page title displayed in the browser.
- **Inputs**: Text content (e.g., "HTML Tutorial").
- **Outputs**: Browser tab shows "HTML Tutorial."
- **Visual Cues**: Title appears in the tab, toolbar, and favorites.
- **Common Errors**:
  - Missing `<title>`: Blank tab or file path displayed.
    - **Fix**: Include `<title>` in `<head>`.
  - Vague title (e.g., "Home"): Poor SEO.
    - **Fix**: Use descriptive text (e.g., "Space Exploration Guide").
- **Validation Check**: Save as `title.html`, open in a browser, and confirm the tab shows the title.

## Section 2 — Class Exercise

This exercise helps you practice adding a favicon and setting a page title.

**Theme**: Create a webpage about a favorite topic (e.g., space exploration) with a favicon and a descriptive title.

**Objectives**:
- Use `<link>` with `rel`, `type`, and `href` to add a favicon.
- Use `<title>` to set a meaningful page title.
- Save and view the page in a browser.

**Stepwise Instructions**:
1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad or TextEdit).
2. Create a new HTML file with the basic structure:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <title>Your Title Here</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
3. In `<head>`, add:
   - A `<title>` with a descriptive name (e.g., "Space Exploration Guide").
   - A `<link>` tag for a favicon (e.g., `href="images/favicon.ico"`).
4. In `<body>`, add:
   - An `<h1>` for the page title (e.g., "Space Exploration Guide").
   - A `<p>` with brief content.
   - A comment to document one section.
5. Save as `space.html` in a folder with a sample favicon (e.g., `images/favicon.ico`).
6. Open in a browser to view.

**Hints**:
- Use a simple ICO or PNG image (16x16 or 32x32 pixels) for the favicon.
- Set `type` to match the favicon format (e.g., `image/x-icon` for ICO, `image/png` for PNG).
- Ensure the title is specific (e.g., "Space Exploration Guide" instead of "Home").

**Checkpoints**:
- Does the favicon appear in the browser tab?
- Does the tab show the correct title?
- Is the comment invisible in the browser?

## Section 3 — Weekly Project

This project combines favicons, titles, and previously learned concepts (e.g., images, links) to create a two-page website about a favorite topic.

**Project Brief**: Build a two-page website about space exploration: a homepage with a favicon, a descriptive title, an image, and a link to a Details page, and a Details page with a favicon, a title, and an image link back to the homepage.

**Milestones**:
1. **Homepage (`index.html`)**:
   - Include a `<title>` (e.g., "Space Exploration Home").
   - Add a `<link>` for a favicon (e.g., `favicon.ico` in `images/`).
   - Include an `<h1>`, an `<img>` with `src`, `alt`, and `style`, and an `<a>` to `details.html`.
   - Add a comment.
2. **Details Page (`details.html`)**:
   - Include a `<title>` (e.g., "Space Exploration Details").
   - Add a `<link>` for the same favicon.
   - Include an `<h1>` and an `<a>` with an `<img>` linking back to `index.html`.
   - Add a comment.
3. **Testing**:
   - Save both files in a folder with a favicon and image.
   - Open `index.html` in a browser and test favicon, title, image, and navigation.

**Success Metrics**:
- Both pages show the favicon in the browser tab.
- Titles are descriptive and appear in tabs.
- Image displays and links navigate correctly.
- Comments are invisible in the browser.

**Research Prompts**:
- Explore favicon creation tools (e.g., favicon.cc).
- Research SEO best practices for page titles.

**Extension Ideas**:
- Add CSS to style links or the background.
- Include a responsive `<picture>` element on the Details page.

## Completion Checklist

- **Learning Goals**:
  - Use `<link>` with `rel`, `type`, and `href` for a favicon.
  - Use `<title>` for a descriptive page title.
  - Combine with images and links from prior lessons.
- **Runnable Example**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Space Exploration Guide</title>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="images/favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Main title -->
    <h1>Space Exploration Guide</h1>
    <p><img src="rocket.jpg" alt="Rocket in space" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>
    <p><a href="details.html">More Details</a></p>
    <!-- <p>Draft: Add more content.</p> --> <!-- Hidden draft -->
</body>
</html>
```

- Save as `index.html` and create a `details.html` with a `<title>`, `<link>` for favicon, `<h1>`, image link back to `index.html`, and a comment. Use sample favicon and image (`favicon.ico`, `rocket.jpg`).
- **Checklist for Completion**:
  - [ ] Files start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and include `<html lang="en">`.

  - Incorrect `type` for favicon format.
  - Missing images or links.
- **One-Line Summary**: HTML favicons and titles are added with `<link>` and `<title>` tags, enhancing webpages with recognizable icons and descriptive titles, viewable in a browser after saving as HTML files.
